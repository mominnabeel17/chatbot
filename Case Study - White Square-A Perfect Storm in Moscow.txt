WHITE SQUARE : A PERFECT STORM IN MOSCOW   
 
Sometimes it is necessary to be lonely in order to prove that you are right.  
—Vladimir Putin, President of Russia .1   
 
It was early 2009 , and Brian Patterson sat crestfallen in his Moscow office as the world economy 
unraveled in the wake of the global financial crisis (“GFC”) .  He was under heavy pressure from 
KremlinCo, his local Russian partner , to sell White Square as soon as possible.   
 
White Square was a premier office project that Patterson’s firm , BIG/Lincoln , was developing in  
Moscow  (see Exhibit 1).  After six years , the development was nearing completion .  However, 
KremlinCo was reeling and needed liquidity.  A sale, if consummated,  would monetize the 
project’s $100  million  of invested equity  – plus a small  profit .  An immensely dispiriting outcome  
to Patterson , this was  a fraction of the  over $475 million in profit that looked so achievable only 
a short time earlier .  If Patterson  pressed on, the project faced a risky future  and the real possibility 
of a loss of his partners’ $100 million  of equity (includ ing land that KremlinCo  had contribut ed).   
 
In the midst of his angst, Patterson tried to comprehend how thing s had gone so wrong for White 
Square .  Until very recently, the 76,000 square -meter  project (818,000 square feet) had all the 
right elements —a premier location, world -class tenants, a well -capitalized investor, financing 
from a top -tier German bank, the mos t experienced contractor in Moscow, and a reputable local 
partner .  Just a few months earlier, the pro forma reflected a jaw -dropping $475 million profit on 
$315 million in total project costs.  
   
Patterson’s dilemma comprised two very different types of challenges: 1) managing the project -
level  problems that were expected for  a development of this size and complexity , and 2)  perhaps 
more vexing, navigating among the  diverg ent interests of his  capital partners .

Project Development Problems  
Patters on’s problems were numerous.  Construction was behind schedule  and the contractor was 
demanding a massive $40 million price increase —the result of the contractor mismanaging its 
own contractual risk and getting jammed  by the local concrete supplier.  The anchor tenant only 
wanted half its lease square footage  amid a once white -hot Moscow office market that was now 
in free fall .  And the project’s German lender was looking for a reason to call its loan and exit 
Russia.  Patterson  couldn’t escape the om inous macroeconomic headlines from around the world: 
Yes, t he sky was falling.   He was facing an uphill battle, even by the exacting burdens expected 
of a developer.  If he couldn’t solve these problems, he would simply have to sell.   
Divergent Interests Among the Partners  
While Patterson was busy addressing  project -level problems, KremlinCo  had dredged up a 
purchase offer from a Kazakh buyer  for invested  cost ($100 million) plus $25 million  of profit.  
On the heels of a pro forma that reflected a project value of $790 million and  profit of $475  
million , this would mean abandoning  an extraordinary potential return.  
 
When White Square was originally conceived  back in 2004 , Patterson had convinced KremlinCo 
to contribute the land for a one-third  ownership interest in the project.  This simplified the 
negotiation over land value and oriented KremlinCo’s focus toward  the ultimate value of the 
project by partner ing with BIG/Lincoln —a firm with  developm ent expertise and deep -pocketed 
financial back ing.  The principal of KremlinCo also had important relationships in Moscow .  As 
an outsider, Patterson felt these relationship s were critical to his success  as the developer .  
 
Separately, Patterson’s capital partner, BIG Life, was grappling with its own GFC -related 
financial problems .  The sale to the Kazakh investor w ould return a modest profit alongside BIG 
Life’s $62 million of cash equity invested in White Square  and would help shore up its own 
rapidly deteriorating balance sheet .  Valuations across BIG Life ’s global portfolio were 
plummeting , and there was no telling when the bleeding would stop .  But the old axiom  remained 
true—cash was king —and BIG Life knew it would take more of it to work through  the GFC .  
 
Patterson, on the other hand, was heavily incentivized to proceed .  Although he had not invested 
cash in the deal , Patterson had committed to fund up to $40 million in project cost overruns  if 
necessary and therefore had  something to lose.   But with a healthy share of the profits , he stood 
to make a sizeable personal fortune based on the pro forma of just a few months ago . 
 
After many years of laying the groundwork for th e project and establishing  his reputation as a 
developer in Russia, Patterson found the thought of giving up now nauseating .  However, he had 
a fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interests of his partners .  How could he balance these 
competing interests while keeping his o wn vision alive after six long years of work?  (See Exhibit 
2 for a timeline of the White Square development project.)  
FROM TEXAS TO RUSSIA  
Patterson, a country boy from Texas, had moved to Warsaw in 1992 as a recent Stanford GSB 
graduate to pursue adventur e and to set up his own property development company .  By 2001, he 
was running BIG/Lincoln , a Warsaw -based real estate company  that was developing projects to 
capitalize on the rapid growth in Central and Eastern European markets after the fall of the Sovi et 
Union.  He was currently building five projects across Poland at a total cost of over $250 million .

  p. 3 
BIG/Lincoln  was a joint venture (“JV”) between Patterson , BIG Life and Lincoln Property 
Company (see Exhibit 3 for an overview of the partnership structure ).  BIG Life, a New York -
based global insurance company with $30 billion invested in real estate , was the “money partner .”  
BIG Life was active in 50 countries and expanding .  Lincoln Property Company , a real estate 
developer  based in Dallas , was one of the largest real estate firms in the U nited States , with 
projects across North America  and Europe .  Lincoln was the “development partner”  for the 
BIG/Lincoln JV, which was led by Patterson .  The combinat ion of Patterson and two premier 
firms made a strong team emerging market  development team . 
 
More than a decade after the fall of communism, the Russian economy was growing rapidly, and 
the country welcomed foreign investors .  While t he 1998 Russian financial crisis had dealt a major 
setback to the economy, BIG Life reasoned that by 2001  the worst was behind  them  (see Exhibit s 
4 and 5).  While  there were still major challenges to doing business in Russia , BIG Life sensed  
opportunity and asked Lincoln and Patterson to expand BIG/Lincoln ’s footprint there .   
Finding a Partner  
BIG/Lincoln ’s first order of business was to find a Russian development partner to navigate local 
rules, regulations, and laws —which could be idiosyncr atic and difficult for outsiders to 
understand .  Moscow was new territory to Patterson, and he knew he needed a local on his side  
to avoid the plague of costly mistakes that often afflict investors entering a new  market .  A deep -
pocketed capital source like BIG Life and an experienced developer like Lincoln made for an 
appealing combination to prospective local partner s.  After a thorough courting process , 
BIG/Lincoln settled on  KremlinCo, a Russian metals and mining conglo merate  that had deep 
relationships in government  and previous real estate experience . Adding to its allure, KremlinCo 
owned  some land that seemed like an ideal site for development .  Patterson valued KremlinCo’s 
size and government connections —attributes he believed would be helpful for future projects .  In 
January 2004, BIG/Lincoln and KremlinCo drafted  a business plan and a development agreement .  
The nascent partnership began working on the development of its first venture —a three -building 
office complex that would come to be known as White Square.  
A ‘WHITE’ HOT MARKET  
Launching the development of White Square in late 2004 seemed opportune .  Russia  had six years 
of strong economic growth under its belt , an investment -grade sovereign debt ratin g, and it was 
pursuing membership in the WTO.2  Although Moscow had a dearth of sophisticated real estate 
developers, industry analysts were comparing its real estate market to London and Paris, the most 
prominent markets in Europe .  A study in Emerging Trends in Real Estate  ranked Moscow the 
best market on the continent .3  And it was a landlord’s market: There were so few quality office 
buildings that the existing stock was subject to competition among tenants seeking space .  
Furthermore, becaus e the design and permitting process in Russia typically took about three years, 
developers like BIG/Lincoln knew there was a paucity of new supply coming to market.

freely as possible.”   See the WTO website, https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whAtis_e/inbrief_e/inbr00_e.htm

By 2006, White Square ’s design and permitting was complete d, after just two years .  Among  
project s of this size and complexity , it was the fastest  to navigate the byzantine Moscow 
permitting process —something that helped convince  Patterson that KremlinCo was the right local 
partner choice.    
 
Given the shortage  of quality office space and Russia’s economic growth, Class A office market 
vacancy was only  three percent, and rents were rising rapidly .  BIG/Lincoln ’s original rent 
assumptions  from the 2004 pro forma of $500 per square meter (“m2”) per year were now below  
current market rental rates of $650 per m2 just two years  later.  Including other  revenue, the 
project’s 2004 pro forma annual net operating income (“NOI”) was $42 million (weighted average 
rent of $554 per m2).  Based on projected all -in development costs of $230 million, or $3,000 per 
m2, this would result in a generous 18.3 percent unleveraged development yield on cost.4

For most of the twentieth  century, new development in communist Moscow consisted of drab 
buildings that emphasized function over form .  Modern Class A office buildings were rare but 
nonetheless still traded at high cap rates of over 12 percent.5  By buildi ng to an 18.3 percent yield 
on cost in a 12 percent cap rate market, White Square was being constructed at a development 
premium  (or ‘mark up’) of over 50 percent .  Patterson knew this was an enviable position; his 
peers in the United States and other more mature markets were  building to a 15  to 25 percent 
markup .  However, this large markup reflected  the many risks inherent in a development project  
in an emerging market : currency fluctuation s, political uncertainty, market instability, fluid 
regulatory environments, limited  financing  alternatives , and unstable  economic conditions.  
 
Based on Russia’s improving economy and the anticipated credit quality of the tenants that a 
premier project like White Square would attract, BIG/Lincoln believed it might command a 
market -leading cap rate upon sale of up to 10 percent .  With $42 million in NOI, this would equate 
to a $421 million value —an eye-popping  profit of $191 million .

4 The difference between th e yield on cost and the cap rate is the development spread . The development spread 
represents the profit margin between what a project cost to build and its as -built value  at prevailing market rates.  
5 In developed markets, cap rates are often in the mid -single digits for Class  A office buildings .  However, in emerging 
markets, like Russia, cap rates are higher reflect ing the numerous additional risks borne by investors.

Construction Begins  
BIG/Lincoln  wanted to build to its typical world -class standards .  Meanwhile, KremlinCo had 
only known poor building standards and had never seen a hot real estate market .  Jittery that the 
market might evaporate overnight, KremlinCo was restless during the design process .  These 
contrasting  philosophies created  nascent  tension.  
 
By early  2006 , BIG/Lincoln  received  construction bids from multiple general contractors .  
Bosphor us Construction (“Bosphorus”) had the low bid and was hungry for the job .  Based in 
Istanbul, Bosphorus had been active in Moscow for over 15 years and was also a large owner of 
office buildings and shopping centers .  Most of these projects were joint vent ures with the City 
of Moscow  (the “City”),  offering the apparent comfort of a close relationship with the City.6  In 
contrast to the scenario in many Western markets, the City was Moscow’s largest landowner, a 
legacy of communist times when the government owned all property .  Patterson believed that 
Bosphorus’ relationship with the City would come in handy, as the construction process would 
require many permits .  However, the fact that Bosph orus was building the project while also 
serving as a landlord in the Moscow office rental market —and therefore a competitor —was a 
clear conflict of interest that gnawed at Patterson .  
 
The construction contract  required Bosphorus to deliver the first of t hree buildings before the end 
of 2007 .  As the first building to be delivered was also the smallest building of the three (6 stories 
and 10,000 m2), this timeline seemed reasonable .  The other two buildings ( each 15 stories high, 
and totaling 66,000 m2) were to be completed by September 2008 .7  Delivery deadlines were 
critical  because BIG/Lincoln  intended to sign pre -leases that would include tenant -driven 
occupancy deadlines .  A significant delay by Bosphorus  would therefore require BIG/Lincoln  to 
make penalty payments to the tenants .   
 
Bosphorus was only obligated to deliver the buildings in “shell and core” condition .  This included 
all the fire and life safety systems, fully  finished lobbies, lifts, and all utility connections .  As was 
customary in Moscow, White Square tenants would be required to complete their own tenant 
improvements (“TIs”).8  By April 2006, with a newly issued construction permit in hand, 
Bosphorus commenced the build of White Square  as Patterson allowed himself a moment of 
celebration.  Everything seemed to be  going according to plan.  
Early Leasing Efforts Pay Off  
BIG/Lincoln  had spent much of the pre -construction period in 2004  and 2005 courting 
international companies active in Moscow to sign pre -leases .  Its hunch about the appeal of a 
Class A project in a central Moscow location was borne out as both PwC and Deloitte wanted 
large leases.9  As word of strong tenant demand spread, other premier tenants , including  
McKinsey & Co., were interested in the remaining space .  Smaller tenants were  attractive to 
Patterson because non -anchor tenants paid more in rent —in some cases up to 30 percent more .  
In mid -2006, lease negotiations were nearly finalized with Deloitte for 30,000 m2, the largest pre -
lease in Moscow  history.  
                                                           
6 The City of Moscow often entered into ventures with developers , making it powerful in  the local commercial real 
estate market . 
7 The project’s 76,000 m2 included  70,000 m2 of office space and 6,000 m2 of retail space . 
8 This contrasts with developed markets , where TIs are typically the responsibility of the landlord.  
9 The “Big Four”  accounting firms ( Deloitte, PwC, EY , and KPMG)  were  the four largest  professional services 
networks  in the world, offering  audit , taxation , management consulting , actuarial , and corporate finance services.   
 
White Square: A Perfect Storm in Moscow   RE -140 
 
  p. 6 
 
But Deloitte balked at the idea of constructing (and paying for ) TIs.  The American company  was 
conditioned to an experienced developer handling the T Is—and this proved to be both a problem 
and an opportunity for BIG/Lincoln .  Vacancy in the Class A segment had fallen further to an 
unfathomable 0.5 percent and rents  now exceeded $700 per m2.  Earlier in the negotiation, 
BIG/Lincoln  and Deloitte agreed to a rent rate of $580 per  m2—by 2006, this turned out to be 
almost 20 percent below the going market  rate. 
 
BIG/Lincoln  decided that i f the development team  agreed to both pay for and construct Deloitte’s 
TIs, it could push for a rent increase .  It seemed a crafty way to move the rent up to market  rates .  
BIG/Lincoln  proposed financing $40 million of Deloitte’s TIs (90 percent of the $44 million in 
estimated TI costs) in exchange for increasing the rent to $850 per m2 and a 10 -year lease  (versus 
the original 7 years)  (see Exhibit 6 ).  Deloitte countered by asking for signage rights, nine months 
of free rent, and  the right to terminate for construction delays.10  BIG/Lincoln  agreed to the counter 
terms , even though the termination right left it expos ed to significant risk  if the building was not 
ready on schedule .  To protect itself, BIG/Lincoln  set the lease occupancy date for June 2009 —
nine months after the scheduled  construction delivery date  of September 2008 . 
 
By trading nine months of free rent for a higher  “face” rent, Patterson created additional potential 
value.11  This also set a new market rent as a baseline for  negotiating with other tenants .  All in 
all, Patterson believed BIG/Lincoln  was being well compensated  for handling the TIs .  Increasing 
the rent by $270 /m2 contributed $8.1 million of additional NOI.  It represented a marginal yield 
of over 20 percent on $40 million in TIs and a healthy development margin  in excess of 50 percent . 
Twin Leases  
By late spring 2006, BIG/Lincoln ’s discussions with PwC to lease the other large building (32,000 
m2 of space) had reached an advanced stage .  But with a hitch .  PwC’s existing landlord was a JV 
between Bosphorus and t he City .  The lease for that space was set to expire before White Square’s 
scheduled completion date, necessitating a short -term extension to bridge the timing gap .  With 
conflicting interests on all sides, BIG/Lincoln , PwC , and Bosphorus compromised .  PwC ’s 
existing lease was extended to seven months after White Square’s scheduled completion.  
 
PwC also wanted Deloitte’s TI deal .  BIG/Lincoln  agreed to fund $45 million of PwC’s TIs (90 
percent of PwC’s estimated TI cost of $50 million) .  The rent initially quoted to PwC ( $550 per 
m2) was even lower than the rent to which Deloitte had initially agreed ($580 per m2).  PwC’s rent 
was raised to $850 per m2, matching Deloitte’s  rent. 
The Fix is In… 
By 2006,  over 80 percent of White Square was pre-leased to PwC and Deloitte at rents of $850 
per m2, and pro forma  NOI had increased to $71 million (~70 percent higher than the initial 2004 
pro forma of $42 million) .  Including the $85 million in TIs for Deloitte a nd PwC, the all -in 
development costs had also increased (to $315 million ) but the unleveraged development yield on 
cost had increased to 22.6 percent —versus  the original pro forma of 18.3 percent . 
 
                                                           
10 Signage rights at a development of White Square’s prominence  had real economic value as a way to market to  
tenant s. 
11 When NOI increase d, project value would go  up by a multiple —the reciprocal of the cap rate.

  p. 7 
With high -quality tenants and a growing number of investors searching for acquisitions in the 
supply -constrained Moscow market,  BIG/Lincoln  now believed it could achieve a cap rate closer 
to 9 percent at sale .  This would imply a value  of $790 million on development costs of $315 
million —a profit of $475 million , nearly four times  the initial pro forma  profit of $ 121 million . 
   
The new pro forma looked great in BIG/Lincoln ’s financial model .  But behind the numbers, 
BIG/Lincoln  had meaningfully dialed up its construction risk .  BIG/Lincoln  had added $85 
million in cost, nearly double the $100 million original hard cost budget , and significantly 
increased construction management complexity  by taking on the TI construction .  Both PwC and 
Deloitte were large, international firms with dozens of partners in Mos cow.  Such partnerships 
often have heated debates about office space design , resulting in frequent change requests  that 
add to the construction time line and increase the risk of a delayed completion .

In parallel with the permitting and leasing efforts,  BIG/Lincoln  had been seeking  construction 
financing .  Hypoveireinsbank (“Hypobank”) was a German bank that had been successful in 
Central Europe for years in the difficult emerging market s.  The bank had made multiple loans to 
BIG/Lincoln  in Central Europe  and was anxious to access the Russian market through a borrower 
with whom they had experience in other markets .  White Square checked all the boxes .  By 
summer  2006, BIG/Lincoln  and Hypobank  had agreed to a $ 215 million loan , 70 percent of the 
$315  million in project costs —reflecting the value of the pre -leases (and reducing  the bank’s risk).  
TROUBLE ON THE BOSPHORUS  
As Russian author Leo Tolstoy once wrote, “It was smooth on paper, but we fo rgot about the 
ravines.”   In fact, th is development was nowhere near as smooth as it appeared on paper .  By 
January 2007, only nine months after construction started, Bosphorus was already six months 
behind schedule .  The contractor had recently taken on s everal large projects without having 
enough labor or equipment to handle them all simultaneously .  Rumor s spread that Bosphorus 
was moving labor and equipment between the job sites frequently to mask its resource limitations.  
 
During 2007  and 2008, there were ominous signs of trouble throughout the world economy, and 
the U.S . dollar was weakening precipitously against both the Euro and the Ruble .  Currency 
volatility could be particularly problematic in emerging markets because many of the materials 
could not  be sourced in  the market  where the project was being built .  Bosphorus was buying 
materials from various countries in an array of currencies .  Although the contract  obligated 
Bosphorus to hedge the currency risk, it had not  done so —a violation of  the agreement .  Patterson

was reminded that delegating risk management was effective only when the counter -party was 
capable of managing the risk itself .  Because the proverbial buck stops with the developer, mistakes 
by vendors and service providers often became a developer’s biggest problem.   BIG/Lincoln  also 
began to sense that local materials procurement was a problem .  The primary materials required 
for the initial 19 months of construction were concrete and steel ; when Patterson requested copies 
of the procurement agreements, Bosphorus refused  to provide them . 
How Much?!?!  
As Patterson’s blood pressure rose, Bosphorus requested an urgent meeting .  The Bosphorus 
project manager had a poker  player’s  countenance as he walked into BIG/Lincoln ’s confer ence 
room .  He explained that the monopoly concrete supplier in Moscow claim ed the price had 
doubled .  The supplier demanded that Bosphorus pay the elevated price, or no concrete.12  As 
Patterson listened, he wondered to himself “how much could it possibly cost?”  The answer: $40 
million!  His mind raced .  Although the contract  explicitly assigned this risk to Bosphorus, it pled 
financial distress and explained that BIG/Lincoln  must pay  the incremental cost .  Patterson  also 
knew th e unfortunate maxim when working with contractors —if job losses exceed the outstanding 
guarantee  ($20 million) , the contractor could  just “walk  the site.” 13 
Zeig Mir das Geld! (“Show Me the Money”)  
As if on cue, Hypobank  called.  Its board was increasingly wary of the bank’s  exposure in Russia .  
Many of its loans were in default in other European markets .  After being bailed out by the German 
government , the bank was facing political pressure to exit the emerging markets .  Hypobank 
handed BIG/Lincoln  an ultimatum: If construction of White Square was not complete d by June 
2009 —as mandated in the loan agreement —the bank would accelerate the loan .  Hypobank’s 
attorneys also claimed  that the June 2009 completion deadline included TIs . 
 
The lynchpin risk that Patterson’s plan had been carefully crafted to avoid was manifesting  itself 
as BIG/Lincoln ’s construction delivery contingency now seemed inadequate .  It was becoming 
increasingly clear that the glue that held the whole project together was meeting the construction 
deadlines in the leases and loan agreements . 
Now What?  
BIG/Lincoln  formulated a plan to get the tenants moved in on time .  It would require Bosphorus’ 
cooperation in a time of rapidly deteriorating goodwill between the two firms .  BIG/Lincoln  
wanted to hire a second contractor to save time by parallel processing PwC and Deloitte’s TIs on 
site while Bosphorus was finishing building construction.14  Bosphorus resisted —arguing it could 
finish the project on time and a separate TI contractor would just disrupt building construction.  
 
BIG/Lincoln  worried there was a more sinister problem at hand .  The overall vacancy rate in 
Moscow had spiked from 0.5 percent to 6 percent, and cap rate s were climbing  for the precious 
                                                           
12 Given the high cost of transporting concrete, suppliers often develop strong geography -based spheres of influence, 
where it is cost -prohibitive for buyers to procure concrete from alternate sources.  
13 In the construction contract, Bosphorus guaranteed a p ayment of up to $20 million to BIG/Lincoln if performance 
terms were not met.  If Bosphorus expected its losses to exceed this liability amount, it might decide to walk away 
and force BIG/Lincoln to sue for payment of the guaranty, leaving Patterson with a lawsuit and without  a contractor.  
14 Building contractors prefer to finish construction before allowing a TI contractor on site. Contractors prefer to 
work alone to minimize congestion on site and to reduce ‘finger pointing’ and competing liability claims .

few building sales in the market .  Now that the Moscow office market was teetering on the edge, 
Bosphorus’s motivations were conflicted.  PwC was still paying $500 per m2 rent under a ~30,000 
m2 lease in a Bosphorus -owned building —$15 million annually .  The market had been  buoyant 
when Bosphorus initially signed the contract , and  Bosphorus was confident it could re -lease the 
space vacated by PwC .  Patterson was concerned Bosphorus might not compl ete the buildings on 
time even if  BIG/Lincoln  agreed to the $40 million price increase.  
 
BIG/Lincoln  was also working on a back -up plan to replace Bosphorus  altogether .  However, a ny 
new contractor would demand an increased price to reflect the current market  condition s.  In 
theory, half the p rice increase could be offset by collecting the $20 million  guarant ee from 
Bosphorus for its  contract default .  But collecting the $20  million  claim was far from assured.  
 
There was a nother consideration : no new contractor would provide warranties for the work that 
Bosphorus had already completed.15  By terminating Bosphorus,  BIG/Lincoln  would waive the 
right to make future warranty claims , leaving BIG/Lincoln  without remedy for any defects arising 
from Bosphorus’ work .  The absence of warranties  could significantly affect the cap rate at sale 
and therefore reduce the exit price .  There was no clear solution .  But a decision had to be made 
quickly , as each day ate into the construction cushion .   
The Duel with Deloitte  
Adding to BIG/Lincoln ’s growing list of challenges, rumors were circulating about Deloitte’s 
business .  Although Deloitte originally only needed half of the 30,000 m2 space, it had pre-leased 
the entire building .  Deloitte planned to sublease the extra space initially , and expand over time .  
But with the declining economic conditions, Deloitte’s growth plans proved overly aggressive  as 
sublease prospects dimmed . 
 
In mid -2008, as Patter son was focused on Bosphorus’ construction problems and the economic 
environment spiraled downward, Deloitte asked for its own meeting with BIG/Lincoln .  Deloitte 
announced it would not honor its pre -lease obligations .  A peculiarity of Russian law stated that 
a “lease” could be signed only once the developer received a state -registered ownership 
certificate —after the buildings were completed .  Posturing, Deloitte argued that the pre -lease  
might not be  binding.   Patterson’s local lawyers assured him that Deloitte’s threat was hollow and  
Russian courts  would side with White Square .  However, suing an anchor tenant was not an 
appealing option .  It would take time and cost money .  It would also lead to a loan default.  
 
Deloitte demand ed that BIG/Lincoln  reduce its lease space by half .  Although there  was never a 
good time for a request like this, with ballooning vacancy rates throughout Moscow and amid a 
perilous problem with its contractor —this qualified as a terrible time .  If BIG/Lincoln  did not 
agree to a smaller lease, Deloitte might never pay any rent .  Deloitte might also just declare local 
bankruptcy .  BIG/Lincoln  believed this was unlikely as Deloitte’s global brand would be 
damaged .  But these were challenging times and reputable companies were taking extreme actions 
merely to survive.  
                                                           
15 Contractors provide performance warranties as an insurance policy against the inevitable problems that arise 
following construction completion.   If a defect arises after construction is complete, and the contractor is deemed to 
be at fault, the develop er can claim damages under the warranties set forth in the construction contract.  Typically, 
contractors guarantee mechanical, electrical , and plumbing work for three years, structure for 10 years, etc.

KremlinCo’s White Knight  
Although KremlinCo was a well -capitalized metals and mining company pre -crisis, it too was 
suddenly in peril.  In the face of falling commodity prices, the company’ s asset -backed lenders 
had declared a technical loan default, citing breaches of loan -to-value covenants .  Desperate for 
cash, KremlinCo demanded that BIG/Lincoln  agree to immediate ly sell the project .  The joint 
venture agreement (“JV”) between BIG/Lincol n and KremlinCo provided that neither partner 
could require a sale until one year after construction completion —a common JV provision.   These 
were certainly not normal times, and agreements were being regularly re -visited .  BIG/Lincoln  
had used offshore ju risdictions and the JV was governed under English law .  But the business was 
on Russian soil, where KremlinCo had leverage .  Given the conventional wisdom regarding the 
dangers  of doing business as an outsider in Russia , Patterson did not want to “disappoint” 
KremlinCo .  As long days bled into long nights, Patterson would dream up the darkest misfortunes 
that could befall him if he fell out of favor with his partner.  
 
In its desperation, KremlinCo had found a Kazakh investor to buy White Square .  Although 
KremlinCo had been transparent with the buyer about the raft of problems at White Square, the 
Kazakh investor was captivated, reasoning that it could get a trophy asset at a bargain basement 
price .  KremlinCo assured BIG/Lincoln  the Kazakhs could c lose the purchase before construction 
completion, thus providing KremlinCo the liquidity it needed  and BIG  Life the cash it wanted . 
DECISION TIME 
Patterson looked up from his paper -strewn  desk and to the television across his office to see the 
latest news banner running across the bottom of the screen: Banks had lost more than $1 trillion 
since the onset of the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 .  Meanwhile, the White House and U.S. 
Congress were negotiating a complicated ~$800 billion stimulus package .  The bottom was falling 
out of the U .S. real estate market, and seasoned professionals didn’t know what cap rates to 
assume —or even if tenants would pay the next month’s rent.  
 
Any decisions Patterson made in  his own three -dimensional chess game  would impact all parties 
in complex and unpredictable  ways .  Although the profit would be modest, the easy way out was 
the sale to the Kazakhs .  But Patterson had worked tirelessly for six years to assemble  the project  
of a lifetime .  As he studied the pro formas, the range of outcomes was wide  (see Exhibit 7).  Rent 
and cap rate assumptions could hold, or, if things continued to deteriorate, could fall to the levels 
of his initial 2004  pro forma —or worse .  His gut and guile told him  that i f he could  overcome  the 
challenges, White Square would still  make an enormous  profit.   If he failed, he was sure to lose 
the project —and the $100 million his partners had entrusted to him —to the bank .   
 
Patterson had one long day and one sleepless night  until his all-hands meeting with KremlinCo , 
BIG Life, and Lincoln  in 24 hours .  His partners were expecting him  to come prepared with a way 
forward.  Regardless of his recommendation, he would have to anchor the discussion around a 
realistic pro forma to show how the basic economics  would look should the deal succeed.   Under 
these market conditions, that was no easy task.  But he would need that analysi s in hand to make 
a thoughtful recommendation to his partners between doubling down or cashing out.   
 
The analysis would need to be firmly grounded in the context of the deal dynamics and respective 
partnership interests  (see Exhibit 8 ).  The questions his partners would ask ran through his head 
like the ominous news banners streaming across his office television .  Should he agree to 
Bosphorus’s $40 million price increase?   If so, would the conflict arising from Bosphorus’ role

as PwC’s landlord allow it t o complete construction on time?  Could Deloitte’s downsizing 
request be accommodated without undermining the income for the project?  Could the 
construction deadline be met to avoid defaults under the loan agreement and anchor leases?   Was 
Hypobank’s thre at real—and what could Patterson do to mitigate it?   How was he to equilibrate 
the divergent interests of his partners , both in terms of their respective investment capital at risk  
and how much they stood to gain ?  Did KremlinCo, BIG  Life, and Patterson / Lincoln all need to 
walk out of the meeting with the same path forward?    
 
And the big one: Was he kidding himself?  Should  he just take the money and run?   The clock  
was ticking.  It was  decision  time, and fast.

Oil Price Index (Brent Crude $/Barrel)  
 
 
 
The Russian economy was sensitive to oil prices, and its government revenues even more so. In 1997, many 
developing East Asian economies experienced currency crises that destabilized much of the region. This precipitated 
a 50+  percent  fall in global oil prices, which was exacerb ated by a decrease in demand. The accompanying decline 
in Russia’s foreign exchange reserves led to Russia’s default on its domestic debt on August 17, 1998.  Many Western 
investors lost money when Russia’s bond markets shut down. Most notably, the fund Lo ng-Term Capital 
Management lost $4.6 billion during the worst months of the crisis.

prevailing values in the market at the time. (B) By 2006, with the Russian macro economy improving and the development attrac ting premier tenants, Patterson was able 
to move the cap rate to 10%, implying an additional $71 million of project value. (C) At the same time, prevailing rents in t he market had increased to $650/sq m for 
comparable properties, implying $5.5 million more annual NOI. At a 10% cap rate, this increased the project value by $55 million. (D) By agreeing to complete the TIs, 
Patterson increased the contracted rent by over $23 million annually, a nearly 50% increase. However, project costs went up b y $85 million and the risk of completing 
construction on time was increased as well. In all, Patterson was rewarded with an implied $150 million of additional value f or assuming responsibility for the TIs. (E) 
To reflect the supply -constrained market and the signed contracts with two multi -national anchor tenants, the assumed cap rate f or White Square was improved to 9%. 
This generated an incremental $79 million in paper profits. (F) As the market began to deteriorate, Bosphorus demanded a $40 million price increase. (G) With world
