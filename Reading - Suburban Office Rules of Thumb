Suburban Office Rules of Thumb
▪

Landlords and sellers like high load factors. Remember, gross area is the entire floor from outside
window to window (let’s say 11,700 sf). Net Rentable area excludes all vertical penetrations such as
stairwells, ducts and elevator shaft (say 11,000 sf). Usable space is where you can “walk” and
excludes (in addition to vertical penetrations) hallways, bathrooms, elevator lobby (say 10,000 sf for a
full floor tenant and 9,500 if subdivided). The load factor is the ratio of Net Rentable Area to Usable
Area (in this case 1.10 or more commonly 10%) for the full floor tenant and 16% for a small tenant
in a multi-tenant floor.

▪

Landlords like to remeasure buildings to make them bigger. This is notorious in New York where
owners often include ground floor lobby, loading docks, storage space and the deli in the next door
building!

▪

Suburban Office should have 3 - 4 spaces per thousand sf.

▪

Typical FAR for suburban 3 - 4 story building is .35 - .4 (floor area ratio or total Net Rentable Area
divided by land area). Compare to industrial at .50. Three story building is higher intensity of
building but four times as much parking is required.

▪

Average parking space is 335 sf.

▪

Ideal floor size is a function of use. Small tenant profile (2,500 sf) need 35 – 40 feet depths (core to
window) equals 12,000 sf floor size. Larger user/open plan depths at 45 feet equals20,000 – 25,000
sf floor. If floor gets too large, tenants have less access to light and air and it is harder to subdivide.
In Netherlands tenants by law can’t be more than 8 meters from a window! Therefore, European
buildings have small floor plates and narrow bay depths which is nice for the tenant but very
expensive to build and operate.

▪

Perimeter offices are great for executive officers but oppressive for admin staff as they block all
natural light.

▪

Historical Standard – 1 employee per 300 square feet but moving to a more dense standard of 1/200
square feet. Impacts parking ratio. Example: Cisco Systems or Google.

▪

F.A.R. near transit – City providing great density given a project’s proximity to light rail, Caltrain, etc.
Increase of .10 to .65 F.A.R.

▪

Fire/Life Safety had a great impact on buildings 75 feet or higher. Building code triggers additional
fire alarm requirements, additional smoke evacuation requirements, elevator type, and other codes
that increase construction costs. 75 feet (6 stories) is the magic number where anything above this
height is affected by these codes at a premium of $10-15 PSF for the entire building. If the area
requirement is just slightly above the 6 story availability - one suggestion might be, increase the
footprint of the building slightly to add additional square footage and remain under the 75 ft level, or
commit to 120-12 stories to make economical sense. (i.e., If your footprint was 30k SF that would
yield 180 SF of building (6 x 30). If you need 200K SF you could increase the footprint to 33K
instead of 30K and that would be 198K SF.)

Site Density: Surface parking at 3/1000 SF maxes out at approximately 45% coverage. Structured
parking is prohibitively expensive for developments under 75% coverage.
