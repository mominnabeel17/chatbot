▪ Income constrained by competitive market survey, manage to acceptable occupancy (>92%)
• Typical unit turnover once every 12-18 months
Costs as % of Gross Potential Income (GPI) primarily driven by (dependent on):
Administrative 11% management and payroll (level of service) 11%
Operating 7.7% Maintenance 7.1% (age and type of construction)

Determinants of success

▪ Affordability gap required between other housing alternatives and apartments
• High cost of living areas e.g.: Orange County, Washington DC, San Francisco
▪ Constraint on new construction
• Houston low barriers, San Francisco high barrier
• Community perceptions and barriers or growth caps, generally discretionary at local
level
▪ Global economic influences including cap rate, interest rate environment
• 4.5% now, historically 7%-8% cap rate
• Divorce rate, mobility, local preferences – lifestyle renter versus ownership
• Condo conversions stealing tenants but constraining supply
• Transit oriented development nodes & new urbanism concept (live work, live above)
