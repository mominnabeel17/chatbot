Four Theories of Urban Growth
1. CONCENTRIC RING THEORY
Land uses arranged in concentric rings around the Central Business District (CBD).

Order of use rings:
(1) financial,
(2) office,
(3) wholesaling,
(4) heavy manufacturing,
(5) residential,
(6) suburban commuters.

Theory works better for older cities than newer ones, but not as well as other theories.

2. MULTIPLE NUCLEI THEORY
Some uses are where they must be.
Some uses try to be near others which are beneficial.
Some uses locate to avoid hostile uses.
Some uses take best of what is left.

3. SECTOR THEORY
Growth occurs at periphery.
Dynamics of growth are dominated by what happens to high income areas.
High income families live in high value houses.
High value residential areas to locate as follows:
a) Along established, fast lines of travel.
b) On high ground free from floods and with views, preferably near the water.
c) In open-end rather than dead-end areas, cut off from future growth.
d) Include homes of leaders of community.
e) Grow generally outward; do not skip about.
f) May be bent by developers but not relocated.
g) Pull CBD in same direction.
h) Include higher-density, high rise areas near CBD.

4. AXIAL GROWTH
Growth occurs at periphery, first along major arterials to CBD.
Zones around CBD similar to Concentric Ring theory, except boundaries are based on
commuting time to CBD rather than distance.
Interstitial growth (infill between axes) occurs over time, roughly in proportion to
commuting time to CBD.
Zones are (1) CBD, (2) transition zone, (3) workersâ€™ homes, (4) middle and high income
homes, (5) commuter zone
