A Basic Primer on Real Estate Development Economics
Jahan Moslehi, GSB ’10 (revised by Paul Hayes GSB ’20)
Developers create value by constructing a building which is worth more than the ingredients (processing
of entitlements, steel, wood, concrete, land, labor, cost of capital, etc.).
Entitlements are the legal rights to construct a building on a property. There are costs associated with
securing the entitlements (i.e., hiring land-use lawyers or consultants to work with the local jurisdiction to
receive a government-required permit to build).
Although detailed financial models are used to project revenues and costs, developers assess value
creation using simple, back-of-the-envelope calculations. The key calculations are summarized below:
•

NOI / TDC = ROC
o NOI: Net Operating Income
▪ When developers decide if they want to build a building, they analyze the prospective
economics. The first step is to estimate NOI once the building is stabilized—
completely constructed and has achieved full occupancy (tenants in place) less an
assumed vacancy rate (typically a market standard assumption).
▪ NOI is defined as revenues (rent) less expenses (operating costs, taxes and insurance)
and is expressed on an annualized basis
▪ NOI is calculated before accounting for the cost of financial leverage (principal and
interest payments on a mortgage)
o TDC: Total Development Cost
o ROC: Return on Cost (the projected annual return). If this were a bond: annual interest
payment divided by the par value of the bond.
o Example:
▪ If the total projected development cost (TDC) is $10 million and the projected
stabilized NOI is $1 million, the projected return on cost (ROC) is 10% ($1 million /
$10 million)
▪ In real estate terminology, the developer “builds to a 10”

•

Capitalization (Cap) Rate = NOI / Sale Price
o The cap rate is the buyer’s initial rate of return (annualized) after purchasing a real estate
investment property
o Example (continuing from above):
▪ If a property that generates $1 million in NOI sells for $12.5 million, the cap rate is
8%
▪ $1 million / $12.5 million = 8% (buyer’s annual rate of return)
o Because this is an algebraic equation, any two variables allow you to solve for the third
variable:
▪ Example: if a property’s NOI is $1 million and the market determines the appropriate
cap rate is 8%, then the sale price is $12.5 million

▪ $1 million / 8% = $12.5 million
o How is the cap rate determined?
▪ Like all financial investments, the market decides based on its assessment of the risk
of a real estate investment relative to other investment alternatives. For example, if
an investor can earn a 2% annual rate of return on a 10-year US Treasury Bill, how
much higher does the annual rate of return need to be to risk adjust for buying a
building that has a 10-year lease in place? Historically, the required rate of return
premium for income producing real estate (versus the US 10Y Treasury rate) has
averaged ~400 basis points. So, if the US10Y Treasury rate is 2%, the market
determined cap rate for real estate would be 6%. Cap rates may vary significantly
from building to building based on location, tenant credit worthiness, lease terms, etc.
•

Development Profit and Mark-up
o When evaluating the economic merit of developing a project, the developer uses the Total
Development Cost (TDC) and the projected sale price of the project once stabilized to
calculate the Development Profit.
o Development Profit = Projected sale price – TDC
▪ Example: if a property’s estimated NOI is $1 million and the market cap rate is 8%,
then the projected sales price is $12.5 million. If the TDC is $10 million, then the
Development Profit is $2.5 million ($12.5 million - $10 million)
o The Development Mark-up is the Development Profit / TDC.
▪ Example: $2.5 million / $10 million = 25%
▪ Developers generally require a Development Mark-up of at least 20% to justify
proceeding with a project.
o Algebra allows you to arrive at the following relationships:
▪ Development Mark-up = ROC / Cap Rate – 1
• Example using numbers above: (10% / 8%) - 1 = 25%
▪ Development Mark-up = Sale Price / Total Cost – 1
• Example using numbers above: ($12.5 million / $10 million) - 1 = 25%
▪ Development Mark-up = (Sale Price – Total Cost) / Total Cost
• Example using numbers above: ($12.5 million - $10 million) / $10 million =
25%
▪ Development Mark-up = Development Profit / Total Cost
• Example using numbers above: $2.5 million / $10 million = 25%

Algebra illustrates that all four formulas are saying the same thing
In this example, the Development Mark-up is 25%.
