A Basic Primer on Carried Interest (aka Promote) and Other Features in Joint Ventures
Chris Mahowald, GSB ’89 (revised by Caleb Cragle and Paul Hayes, GSB ’20)
Basic Terminology
Typically, in real estate joint ventures, there are two parties: the capital source (the money) and the
operator or sponsor (the talent). As a rule, the sponsor sources investment opportunities and executes the
business plan. Sponsors seek equity by partnering with a capital source, who will provide the majority of
the equity (the sponsor typically arranges debt). As forms of compensation for sourcing the opportunity
and providing day-to-day management of the joint venture, the sponsor often receives 1) fees and 2) a
profits interest referred to as a carried interest or promote—terms which are used interchangeably.
Real Estate Joint Ventures
Real Estate Joint Ventures or JVs generally take the form of a limited partnership and are governed by a
limited partnership agreement (‘LPA’). Typically, the operator or sponsor serves as the general or
controlling partner (GP) within the LPA and capital source serves as a limited or passive partner (LP).
The JV’s primary objective is to own and operate a profitable real estate project. Each party within the JV
has its own role and having aligned interests and a clear division of responsibilities within a proper set of
governance provisions is important the for smooth and successful operation of the real estate. Key items
within an LPA include:
•

Capital Contributions: What % of the equity is contributed by each party – 90% LP and 10%
GP is a common ratio. The GP’s contribution (often referred to as the GP co-investment) needs
to be significant in the context of its financial capacity so that it has ‘skin in the game’ and both
parties share in the upside and downside.

•

Control: LPA’s include governance provisions which define how decisions are made within a JV.
Typically, the LPA references an initial business plan which defines the anticipated operating
parameters for the property (e.g., leasing parameters, operating expenses, capital expenditure plans,
etc.). The LPA generally allows the sponsor or GP to execute the business plan within these
parameters. The LPA typically includes a major decisions provision which defines major asset level
decisions such as when to sell (and for how much), refinancings, major leasing decisions, major capital
improvement projects, etc. Generally, the capital provider or LP has approval rights over these
decisions. Often, the LP has the right to replace the operator or GP if the property fails to achieve the
business plan for an extended period.

•

Fees: Since the GP provides operating resources and expertise, it often receives fees to
compensate it for the cost of the resources it provides. Common examples include:
o An acquisition fee for the costs the GP incurs to find, evaluate and close an investment. An
acquisition fee may range from 0.5-2.0% of purchase price of the property. Note that third
party costs are generally capitalized into the JV partnership and thus the acquisition fee is
incremental and compensates the GP for internal resources it provides.
o A property management fee for the costs the GP incurs to operate oversee day-to-day property
operations (e.g., keeping the property clean, systems in working order, etc.). The property
management fee normally ranges from 3-5% of rental revenue. Onsite personnel at a
property (e.g., maintenance personnel) are typically expensed to the property and thus the
property management fee compensates the GP for its oversight of the property.

o An asset management fee for the costs the GP incurs to oversee the JV partnership’s
ownership interest in the property (e.g., monitor and decide on leasing and capital
expenditure activity). The asset management fee normally ranges from .5-1% of the equity
value of the property.
o A construction management fee for the cost the GP incurs to oversee construction activity. This
includes development of new buildings as well as capital expenditures for existing buildings
(e.g., roof replacement or tenant improvement work). Generally, the construction contract
is outsourced to third party construction companies. The construction management fee
normally ranges from 3-7% of the cost of the construction work depending upon the size
and complexity of the construction. GP’s often employ personnel with construction
expertise to oversee the construction process, monitor periodic payment draws under the
construction contract, etc.
o A financing fee for the cost the GP incurs to arrange, negotiate documents and close
financings. Generally, a JV partnership outsources to a mortgage broker the effort to
identify the best lender for a project – and the mortgage broker receives a brokerage fee
which is capitalized into the JV partnership. The broker fee ranges from .5-2% of the loan
amount depending upon the size and complexity of the financing. All third party costs
(e.g., appraisals or environment reports) are capitalized into the loan amount. Infrequently,
the GP may receive an additional financing fee for arranging the loan of up to 1.0% of loan
amount market rate). As part of its arrangement to receive a promote or carried interest,
the GP is generally responsible for providing any guarantees required by the lender.
Carried Interest or Promote
Promote is a type of incentive, profit sharing-based compensation. It is received in exchange superior
performance and/or bearing a disproportionate share of the risk. Promote allows for the sponsor to earn
an outsized portion of the total return in relation to their total investment. Reasons for being awarded
promote include:
• Sourcing the investment
• Providing the skills and operating expertise necessary to execute the business plan (e.g.,
entitlement, development and construction management, and leasing)
• Financing guarantees required by lenders (including construction guarantees)
Note: Promote terminology differs based on the LPA, but generally, the capital source is termed as being promoted. It is
easiest to think of the sponsor as the one promoting the deal.
Determining the Promote Amount
The amount of promote is generally negotiated and may reflect different factors including:
• Experience and track record of the sponsor
• Execution difficulty of the business plan
• Size of the sponsor’s co-investment
• Fees earned by the sponsor outside of the promote (i.e., the more fees, the less promote)
Cash flows in a joint venture are distributed to the parties according to a set of rules and priorities
established in the joint venture agreement. The distribution is known as the waterfall because there are a
series of tiers, each of which has a different distribution ratio. Once the conditions for that tier have been
satisfied, all remaining cash flow falls to the next tier … and so on.
Before the sponsor is entitled to receive its promote, capital sources generally require a return of all
invested capital plus a return on invested capital known as a preferred return. The preferred return is

intended to ensure that the capital source receives a minimum rate of return before the sponsor receives its
outsized profits interest. The preferred return generally ranges from 6% to 12% per annum. Note that all
invested capital is entitled to the preferred return—both the capital source’s as well as the sponsor’s coinvestment. In a typical joint venture, the capital source and the sponsor may invest capital in the ratio of
90/10. The relevant language in the joint venture agreement which addresses the preferred return may
read as follows:
“100% of cash flow is distributed to the Parties pro rata until the parties have received (a) a full return of
their Initial Equity plus (b) an amount necessary to achieve an Internal Rate of Return of 10% per annum
on Initial Equity.”
Once all invested equity and a 10% per annum return on the equity has been distributed, that tier in the
waterfall has been satisfied and the remaining cash flow falls to the next tier, in which the sponsor would
receive its promoted share of all remaining cash flow. The language in the joint venture agreement for the
promote tier in the waterfall may read as follows:
“Thereafter, 15% of cash flow is distributed to Sponsor as a profits interest (“Sponsor Promoted
Interest”); and 85% to the Parties pro rata.”
Example of a Joint Venture Waterfall Calculation
A sponsor buys a building for $1 million (all equity and no debt) which generates $100,000/year of net
operating income. Assume the sponsor invests 10% and the capital source invests the remaining 90%.
The parties agree to pay the sponsor a promote equal to 15% of all cash flow after all capital has been
returned plus a 10% per annum preferred return. Assume the building is sold for $2 million at the end of
the third year.

In the absence of a promote agreement between the parties, all cash flow including the profit is split prorata:
Sponsor →

10% x $2,300,000 = $230,000

Capital Source →

90% x $2,300,000 = $2,070,000

However, since the partnership includes a promote to be paid to the Sponsor (if earned), the sharing of
cash flows is different. The preferred return is 10% per annum and thus the preferred return due in year
one is:
10% x $1,000,000 = $100,000
Since the property earns this amount, the $100,000 is distributed to the parties pro rata in each of the three
years while the partnership owns the property. Note that if the property’s net cash flow was insufficient to
pay the entire amount of the preferred return in any given year, the unpaid portion would accrue and be
added to the invested capital for the following year. Similarly, if the property’s cash flow was in excess of
the preferred return in any given year, the excess would be distributed to the parties in proportion to their
investment (90/10) and the invested capital amounts would be reduced accordingly. Note also that most
property requires some amount of capital expenditures each year and this amount reduces the distributable
cash flow.

When the property is sold at the end of year three for $2 million, the first $1 million must be distributed to
the investors in order to return their invested capital. Once all capital has been returned and the preferred
return is fully paid, the remaining cash flow ($1 million in this example) flows to the next tier in the
waterfall in which the sponsor is entitled to its 15% promote:
Sponsor Promote →

15% x $1,000,000 = $150,000

Remaining Cash Flow →

85% x $1,000,000 = $850,000

In this tier of the waterfall, the remaining cash flow is distributed pro rata to the parties:
Sponsor →

10% x $850,000 = $85,000

Capital Source →

90% x $850,000 = $765,000

In this example, the sponsor invests $100,000 (or 10% of the investment) and receives a return of its
investment plus $265,000 comprising $150,000 in Promote and $115,000 of additional cash distributions.
The sponsor’s total share of profits is 20.4%, an outsized share relative to its 10% investment. Similarly,
the capital source receives a return of its $1 million investment plus $1,035,000 or 79.6% of total profits,
an undersized share relative to its 90% investment.
Additional Considerations
The example above is a simple illustration of the basic concepts. In practice, promote is more nuanced.
Listed below are several common variations of promote conventions:
Multiple-Tiered Waterfalls
Waterfalls may have more than one promote tier designed to compensate the operating partner for
extraordinary performance. Using the example above, although the initial hurdle might be a 15% promote
above (or over) a 10% per annum preferred return, a capital source may offer an additional tier, say a 30%
promote over a 20% preferred return. In this instance, cash flow is distributed according to the first
promote tier (15% to the sponsor as promote and 85% to the parties pro rata) until the capital source has
reached the second tier preferred return (20% in this case) at which point all remaining cash flow is
distributed according to the second tier promote ratio (30% to the sponsor as promote and 70% to the
parties pro rata). The language in the joint venture agreement may be worded as follows:
•

100% of the cash flow is distributed to the Parties pro rata until the parties have received (a) a full
return of their Initial Equity plus an amount necessary to achieve a 10% Internal Rate of Return on
Initial Equity;

•
•

Next, 15% to Sponsor as a profits interest (“Sponsor Promoted Interest”); and 85% to the Parties
pro rata until the Parties have received an amount necessary to achieve a 20% Internal Rate of
Return.
Thereafter, 70% to the Parties pro rata and 30% to Sponsor Promoted Interest

Equity Multiple Hurdles
Occasionally, investments are sold quickly, producing a relatively high IRR, but a comparatively low equity
multiple. Similarly, refinancing may return capital and pay off the preferred return causing the sponsor to
be “in the promote” prematurely.
To address this possibility, a financial partner may impose a minimum holding period, during which the
financial partner may block a sale of the asset until a certain amount of time has elapsed. A financial partner
may also require that in addition to achieving the preferred return, the invested equity must also return a
minimum multiple before the sponsor is entitle to a promote. For example, in addition to the 10% per
annum preferred return, the investment must return a minimum 1.5x equity multiple before the sponsor is
entitled to a promote.
Types of Waterfalls
There are two different ways promote may be allocated, referred to as “European” and “American”
waterfalls. These promote methodologies apply to multiple investments within a fund rather than an
individual investment.
The European, or global, waterfall refers to a promote structure calculated at the fund level. In a
European waterfall, the sponsor is not entitled to promote until the investors have received distributions
equal to all contributed capital plus the preferred return on all capital has been paid (termed “backweighted”). This structure is friendlier to investors, as it ensures that investors receive a return of all
invested capital plus a minimum return before the sponsor is entitled to its incentive compensation.
An American, or deal-by-deal, waterfall refers to a structure in which the sponsor is entitled to promote on
individual assets regardless of the overall performance of the fund. An American waterfall is more
favorable to the sponsor who may receive its promote on one or more strong performing assets while one
or more poorly performing asset may lose money. This has the added benefit (to the sponsor) of
accelerating promote—the sponsor may begin receiving promote when the first asset in the fund liquidates
rather than waiting for enough assets to be liquidated to return all capital (plus the preferred return) for the
entire fund. To protect the investor, joint venture agreements may include a clawback clause. Under the
clawback clause, investors may require the sponsor to hold back or escrow some portion of the promote
(e.g., 25%) that investors can “claw back” if subsequent investments fail to return all investor capital or the
preferred return is unpaid.

Sources of Interest Conflicts in JVs
•

GP Co-investment/Promote: Promote structures allow GPs to receive a disproportionate share of
the profit from a real estate investment. Many GPs push for a small co-investment amount which may
poorly align the interests of the parties.
o Incentive to Chase Risk: GPs may pursue high risk investments and operate a property with
a ‘swing for the fences’ mentality because of their ability to receive an outsized share of the
profits if successful (i.e., pursue a lease with a poor credit tenant that requires high TIs and is
willing to pay a higher rent);
or
o Risk of Low Motivation: If a property underperforms and the prospect for the GP earning
meaningful promote is unlikely, the GP may lose incentive and not be engaged.

•

Fees: GPs may be incentivized to pursue mediocre investments, especially large investments, which
have the potential for high fees. Fees allow GPs to financially benefit regardless of the investment
outcome.

•

Management: Affiliates of the GP are often engaged to asset- or property-manage an investment.
Because the GP gets paid fees for these services whether or not the property performs well, this can be
a source of conflict.

•

Sale: When to sell, and at what price, are important decisions that can lead to conflict between the
parties. If an investment is performing well, LPs may push for longer holding periods for several
reasons: 1) defer taxes, 2) increase multiple on invested capital, and 3) relieve the burden of deciding
how to reinvest the capital. GPs may be more motivated to sell earlier as a sale allows them to
monetize their promote, especially for profitable investments. Conversely, GPs may be pushed to hold
investments longer to perpetuate the investment’s fee stream.
