On May 11, 2015, less than three weeks before their graduation from Harvard Business School
(HBS), Wombi Rose and John Wise sat in a Toyota Tundra pickup truck behind Boston’s South Station,
where their company, Lovepop, sold three-dimensional (3D) paper art cards at a small retail kiosk.
After working feverishly for 16 months, bootstrapping operations with their own savings and a few
loans, the founders had in late April attracted seed funding offers from two different investors. Now
they faced a decision: which offer to accept? Seated side-by-side in the parked vehicle, the friends and
business partners debated the merits of the two offers.
Rose and Wise had founded Lovepop during their first year at HBS after discovering the 3D paper
art of kirigami on a school trip to Vietnam. Soon after, the team began creating their own pop-up cards a
using computer design techniques they had learned while earning undergraduate degrees in naval
architecture. Since founding the company in February 2014, Rose and Wise had worked on the
company at every available moment, between classes and on weekends. Both entrepreneurs planned
to work full-time on scaling the company after graduation. Sixteen months since its founding, Lovepop
had achieved $209,000 in cumulative revenues, but was not yet cash flow-positive, and funds were
very low. A $40,000 loan, granted by OnDeck Capital, would last them through graduation—just 18
days away—but with a monthly burn rate of roughly $40,000, they would need much more than that
to survive.
Then came the investors’ offers in quick succession. One was from Techstars Boston, a start-up
accelerator that would provide three months of mentoring, networking, and exposure to prominent
investors. In return for that support and $18,000 in cash, Techstars wanted 6% equity. In addition,
Techstars had indicated that Lovepop was also eligible for a $100,000 convertible note and that
moreover, they would help the founders secure any additional funds they needed prior to an
institutional round of funding. The second offer was from California incubator Founder.org, which
had offered a $300,000 convertible note. Both investors wanted an answer by the next day. It was now
3 p.m.

a The founders referred to the art form Lovepop used to create its product as slicegami™ because it combined sliceform ship
design techniques with kirigami.
Senior Lecturer Robert F. White, Professor Ramana Nanda, and Case Researcher Olivia Hull (Case Research & Writing Group) prepared this case.
It was reviewed and approved before publication by a company designate. Funding for the development of this case was provided by Harvard

Founding Lovepop
Rose and Wise met in 2005 as engineering undergraduates at New York’s Webb Institute. Rose noted:
The school has 100 people. The only degree is naval architecture and marine
engineering. Everyone who attends receives a full-tuition scholarship. Your freshman
year you’re in a shipyard grinding steel and welding. Your sophomore year you’re sailing
on a ship. I was on a chemical tanker and went across the North Atlantic. John was on a
container ship going to Hawaii. That’s what we did. We learned how to design ships.
After he and Rose earned degrees in naval architecture and marine engineering in 2009, Wise took
a job designing ships in Louisiana. Following a four-year stint designing patrol boats for the U.S. Coast
Guard and Navy, Wise decided to apply to business school with the hope of someday building his own
company. After graduating from Webb, Rose enrolled at MIT to pursue a masters in Computation for
Design and Optimization, and upon graduating from MIT, Rose joined McKinsey & Company,
working mainly on oil and gas and shipping-related projects. In early 2013, Rose happened to be in
Australia working on a consulting project when Wise called him and said he had been accepted to HBS.
Rose recalled:
John had looked up after four years and said, “My entire life is my work, and I have
no ownership in what I am building. I need to learn how to do business, but I’m an
engineer and I don’t know anything about business, so I should apply to business school.”
So that’s how he ended up applying and getting in to HBS. When we spoke, it was after
the first round of applications and there was still time to apply in the second round, so I
applied as well.
In March 2013, Rose was accepted into HBS’s second round of applications; he would join Wise’s class
in the fall. Rose said, “We started at HBS with the thought that we’re going to start a business together.”
In September 2013, the friends moved into an apartment in Harvard Square and began the MBA
program. At HBS, the two continued to discuss and research various entrepreneurial opportunities.
They considered building an industrial fish farm, and attended industry events and networked with
people in the field. But after evaluating various business models, they decided it would not work. They
also investigated the natural gas trucking and trading space, conducting market research and forming
relationships with experts. But ultimately, they felt they were not knowledgeable enough in that arena
to be successful. Rose also worked on several startups in his first year at HBS; one, BevSpot, sold
analytics software to bars, and another built an application (app) to catalog ship inspections.
In January of 2014, the friends traveled to Vietnam for their Field Immersion Experiences for
Leadership Development (FIELD), a component of the HBS first-year curriculum. FIELD paired a
group of first-year MBA students for two weeks with a business in a global location with a problem to
solve. “Six months into our HBS experience, we coincidentally were both selected to go to Vietnam for
FIELD. While in Vietnam, my assignment was working for an online dating company trying to make
a dating app and John was working for an online radio company trying to make their radio app. Things
that we were very qualified to be doing,” Rose said with irony. One evening, while wandering among
street vendors in Ho Chi Minh City, the friends came upon a stall selling pop-up cards. It was their
first encounter with kirigami, a form of origami that involved cutting and folding paper into small
sculptures. In awe, the two examined the intricate shapes. “We were asking ourselves, why haven’t we
ever seen anything like this?” Rose recalled. “We were fighting over who could use it for their own
personal stationery because we didn’t both want the same unique stationery to write thank you notes.”

In addition to the aesthetics of the cards, the naval engineers were intrigued by the underlying
design techniques, which were similar to naval architecture. “We realized we could engineer anything
into a pop-up card,” Rose said. 1 Before leaving Vietnam, Wise and Rose tracked down a manufacturer
and packed a box of cards in their suitcase, with plans to sell the cards to their HBS classmates. They
initially priced the cards at $5, but quickly raised prices to $8 and then again to $13 as they figured out
willingness to pay. Within 30 days, they sold 150 cards. Noted Wise:
With the initial sales success, we decided to start a business. We realized that we
needed to design ourselves, that we needed to own the art, and that the products we had
were really awesome on the surface but they were not tailored to the American market at
all, and we knew that we had the skill sets to do it. So we spent spring break of our first
year designing a holiday line.
To do this, Wise and Rose invested in an electronic cutting machine, and began experimenting with
design software. “Originally it was us in our basement with a Silhouette cutter, which cost about $200,
with a mat that has sticky on it. So you put the paper on it, you stick it to the mat, and then it runs
through the machine. There’s a little knife that just runs around and cuts it out. And you have to peel
it off so it curls when you take it off. It’s horrible. But I designed the first card in 17 hours. I designed
with AutoCAD, b used the Silhouette cutter, made three prototypes and we were ready to go.” The first
original Lovepop card was a paper replica of the mid-19th century clipper ship, The Young America,
whose architect, William H. Webb, had founded the partners’ alma mater (see Exhibit 1 for an
illustration of the original design). After designing six cards this way, they graduated to using a laser
cutter at Danger!Awesome, a makerspace in Cambridge’s Central Square that charged $3 per minute.
At Danger!Awesome’s rate, it cost $100 to prototype a card, on average. The process began with a
sketch on paper, followed by a rendering on design software. Next, the designs were programmed into
a cutting machine or laser cutter, which sliced the paper into shapes according to the software’s
instructions. Finally, the pieces of cut paper were assembled by hand using glue and string. Each design
required multiple prototypes to refine appropriately.
As summer approached, the partners began to discuss the best way to launch their product. They
had at least four major sales channel options. They could list the products on a marketplace such as
Etsy (an online marketplace specializing in handmade wares) or Amazon (a giant Internet retailer), sell
cards on their own website, sell wholesale to boutiques, or sell directly to consumers offline at a small
dedicated Lovepop shop, craft fairs, or a retail kiosk. While Amazon and Etsy would expose their
products to a broad audience, the founders worried that listing costs and other fees would be
prohibitively expensive. In addition, this channel was highly competitive and did not give Lovepop
any ownership of the customer. Alternatively, they liked the idea of selling to boutiques or other
retailers, but wondered how to build those relationships and worried that the margins might be thin.
As for offline direct-to-consumer opportunities, the team did not feel they could stock an entire store
with cards, but felt confident they could fill a table at a craft fair, and eventually, a small retail kiosk
like those found in malls and other places with high pedestrian traffic.
After some deliberation, the founders decided to start by selling directly to consumers—online and
at local craft markets. On April 1, Lovepopcards.com launched with cards available for purchase in
nine categories, including birthday, love, and wedding. Cards sold for $8 to $15 each. In contrast to
traditional greeting cards, Lovepop cards were blank inside because the founders felt personal
messages were more meaningful than printed greetings. The night before the launch, Rose and Wise

b AutoCAD was a brand of computer-aided design (CAD) software.

stayed up emailing everyone in their extended network about their new business to start generating
demand. The first day saw almost $2,000 in sales on the site. The second day, sales dropped to $50.
In addition to listing their cards on the website, the founders also began a content marketing
campaign with the Lovepop blog. The first blog post, “Gratitude Guide: How to Write Meaningful
Thank You Cards,” offered tips for writing thoughtful thank-you notes. “With the popularity of emails,
text messages, tweets and social media posts, communication is becoming more streamlined and less
personal. However, gratitude never goes out of style. Handwritten thank-you notes remain
appropriate and expected in many situations,” the Lovepop team advised. 2
That April, the founders also began to sell cards at the SoWa Open Market in Boston’s trendy South
End neighborhood. Each weekend, the market drew local artisans, farmers, food trucks, and brewers.
There, the founders were able to see customer response to their product first-hand. Wise noted:
People loved the cards. No one had ever seen them before. It was more than just a cool
product. Cards have value, they connect people. From the customer interviews we
conducted, we found that people have a deep personal connection with these cards. HBS
gets you thinking about how you can add meaning to the world; with these cards, we
weren’t just selling something, we were connecting people.
By the spring of their first year, the founders felt their company was beginning to take shape. But
as first-time founders, each milestone brought a new set of questions and strategic dilemmas. Seeking
advice, the friends sought to leverage every resource available to entrepreneurs starting new ventures
at HBS. In mid-April 2014, they entered the school’s New Venture Competition (NVC), a pitch contest
open to early-stage businesses, and were selected as semi-finalists by a panel of judges. “The New
Venture Competition taught me the power of ‘just doing it,’” Wise reflected. 3 “Our first year, we did
NVC mostly for the judging feedback, and we ended up making the semifinals! Being in the semifinals
shortlisted us for summer incubation programs, and the summer incubation programs helped us
understand the opportunity we were sitting on and motivated us to push. NVC was truly an early
catalyst that kicked us off to where we are today.” 4
As NVC semifinalists, the Lovepop founders were eligible for an interview with Founder.org, a
California-based incubator and investor. Established in 2012 by serial entrepreneur Michael Baum, the
non-profit group sought to support young companies founded by full-time students: “We work with
leading colleges, universities and research institutes throughout North America and Europe to advance
student entrepreneurship,” Baum explained. 5 “The goal is to significantly increase the number of student
entrepreneurs by backing the brightest student founders and biggest ideas.” 6 Unlike a traditional
incubator, the program did not offer office space but instead offered a year-long remote mentorship
program conducted via videoconferencing—a convenient format for full-time students. Each week, a
Founder.org mentor met with the founders of the 50 companies in the cohort on Google Hangout. c
In June 2014, Founder.org accepted Lovepop to their year-long remote mentorship program’s second
cohort. The program did not involve an exchange of cash for equity, but rather, provided the team with
c Over the course of the program, the companies competed for $100,000 in prize money, which was awarded to 10 ventures per

cohort. In addition, Founder.org also offered follow-on investments to some firms after they completed the yearlong program.
By September 2014, Founder.org had supported eight participating companies with seed funding. Said Vinay Mahadik,
cofounder of Securely, a Founder.org company, “With the FOUNDER.org investment as a catalyst, Securly was able to go from
being a boot-strapped startup to an over-subscribed $1M+ round within a month.” (Sources: “Founder.org,” from the Revolvy
website, https://www.revolvy.com/main/index.php?s=Founder.org; Vinay Mahadik, “Tech Startups: The FOUNDER.org
Experience,” Entrepreneurship at Wharton, January 21, 2014, https://entrepreneurship.wharton.upenn.edu/blog/tag/techstartups/; accessed August 2017.)

what they hoped would be valuable guidance. In July 2014, Wise and Rose traveled to Paris, where the
cohort of 50 Founder.org-supported companies gathered for a conference. At the conference, the
founders learned about Founder.org’s eight dimensions of company-building (idea, team, product,
business planning, market development, customer development, operations, and fundraising), and
practiced pitching their business to the other participating companies. “Every new person I met had an
amazing story and was pumped to help each other on their journeys,” Rose wrote on the Lovepop blog. 7
In the summer between their two years at HBS, the two founders dedicated themselves to the
company. They were awarded a 12-week summer fellowship from HBS’s Rock Center, which included
a weekly stipend of $600 per week for 12 weeks to offset living expenses. They also took advantage of
the HBS i-lab, where entrepreneurs could set up their operations and use the facility on campus as a
company headquarters. Rose adopted a rigorous weekly routine split between selling cards at Bostonarea open-air markets and managing the daily operations of the business. On Fridays, Saturdays, and
Sundays, he would wake up at 6 a.m., load merchandise and a tablecloth into Wise’s truck, and drive to
one of three local markets. There, he would unload the inventory before scrambling to find a parking
spot and hurrying back—sometimes running, other times on his bicycle—to guard his gear. After selling
cards for 10 to 12 hours, he drove home to count the proceeds and organize the inventory. Rose recalled:
At the end of the day, after literally not eating or drinking anything because I was by
myself just selling there, I would pack up all the gear, run to get the truck, drive back, put
the equipment in the truck, drive home, and spend three hours counting money, counting
inventory, and trying to organize everything that just happened. Around midnight, I
would be exhausted and just pass out. It was like that for three days. And then the week
would start and I could start working on like actual business things. But that revenue was
pretty significant and at no cost, really. It only cost $100 to be at the fair.
On Mondays, he returned to the i-lab and his general management duties. Meanwhile, Wise spent
the summer vetting manufacturers in Vietnam.
By this time, Lovepop sold 12 original designs, including six holiday cards. In addition to the
Lovepop website, the team listed its products on Etsy, and had filled a few custom card orders. The
founders had also signed a wholesale contract with The Grommet, another online retailer specializing
in handmade and unique gifts, to produce a set of six holiday-themed cards.
That summer, Lovepop applied to appear on Shark Tank, a U.S.-based reality television show with
8 million viewers that filmed entrepreneurs pitching to a panel of investors. 8 With only $6,000 in sales,
it was a long shot. After a few interviews, the founders were told they were not selected.
As the fall semester approached, Rose and Wise began to debate whether or not they would return
to HBS for their second year and complete their degrees. The business consumed much of their time
after class and on weekends, leaving little time for academics and networking (not to mention a social
life). At first, Wise advocated that they defer enrollment in the second year of the HBS program. Unlike
Rose, who felt he could easily resume a career in consulting if Lovepop failed, Wise had concerns about
missing HBS’s well-known recruiting season, which he had planned to use as a way to pivot from
engineering into another field. “I said, let’s defer, see what happens with Lovepop, and still have the
option of going back and taking advantage of the recruiting opportunities,” Wise said. “We were also
going into debt for this degree. I wondered, why are we going to school for a lot of money when we
are working 70 hours a week on this business? It was a high-stakes decision for us.”
Ultimately, both decided to return to HBS for the second year, in part because they feared they
would not otherwise complete the degree. At this point, the two considered shutting down the

business. “Going into the EC d year was a very stressful time between us. When we decided to commit
to staying on for a second year at HBS, I basically said ‘Let’s shut this thing down,’” recalled Wise.
“And then we didn’t, and we kind of just kept going.” Instead of expanding their retail presence to
mall kiosks, they decided to focus in the short-term on online sales. “We thought, naively, that the
online business wouldn’t require much effort,” Rose said. By the end of August 2014, Lovepop’s
revenues totaled nearly $40,000.
That fall, the Lovepop founders began to prepare for the busy holiday season. In October, they
launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund production of Christmas and other holiday cards. Within
three weeks, 454 people had pledged more than $21,000 on the site; more than double the original goal. 9
“We are so excited to help you make lasting memories this holiday season,” the team wrote on
Kickstarter. 10 “You will make someone smile, warm their heart, and remind them of your love and
care.” 11 By the end of 2014, Lovepop had generated $95,000 in revenues and incurred roughly $18,000
in operating losses. “The card itself is absolutely gorgeous and very well-crafted,” wrote one Etsy
customer. 12 “Pictures don’t do it justice.” 13
The founders were pleased with their progress in 2014, but knew there were still many
improvements to make. At Lovepop, the card procurement cycle consisted of four major steps: card
design, prototyping, placing the order with the manufacturer and, roughly six weeks later, delivery of
the shipment. According to the terms of the agreement with the contract manufacturers, Lovepop paid
50% of the cost of a shipment upfront (at the time of the order), then 50% on delivery. However, the
quality of shipments was often poor. Wise said,
We bought all our inventory up front, which was very much the reality of that phase
of the business. In addition, we were having huge quality issues. Half of the shipments
would come with the wrong colors and poor quality. We didn’t trust that they were
paying people or providing adequate working conditions. They would say they were
making it one place and then actually make it somewhere else. We thought to ourselves,
we can’t do this!
In January 2015, Wise traveled to Vietnam to investigate. While touring the factories, he became
convinced that the manufacturing process could be brought in-house. He felt such a move would lower
costs, raise the quality of the products, and give Lovepop more control over delivery speeds and factory
working conditions. In March 2015, Wise invited Ha Trinh Quoc Bao, a renowned kirigami designer
who had designed a few cards for Lovepop, for coffee. At the meeting, Wise asked Bao, who was 22
years old and in his final year of architecture school, if he could set up a Lovepop factory. Within two
months, Lovepop transitioned production from contract manufacturing to their small factory in the
coastal city of Da Nang, Vietnam. Rose and Wise gave Bao $15,000 to open the factory, which employed
10 people, measured 80 square meters (861 square feet), and had two laser cutters. Production capacity
was 100 cards per day.
While Wise traveled to Vietnam, Rose began investigating offline retail opportunities beyond the
open-air markets. “We wanted to figure out how to increase sales and reach a certain level of
consistency,” Rose said. Online sales were seasonal—they peaked during major holidays but slumped
other times of the year. January was particularly slow. Having heard that Boston’s South Station train
terminal attracted a lot of foot traffic, Rose “cold-emailed” the station management to inquire about
available retail space. The station offered Lovepop a one-month pop-up shop, and available dates
coincided with Valentine’s Day. They asked Colin Spillane, an employee and fellow Webb alumnus, to
d At HBS, the second year of the program is known as the elective curriculum, or “EC.”

build and manage the kiosk. Spillane built the $2,000 kiosk with Home Depot plywood in his garage.
During February 2015, cards flew off the kiosk into customers’ hands—in total, Lovepop sold $34,000
cards at the kiosk alone during a single one-month period. For the fiscal year 2014 and the four months
ended April 2015, the Kiosk channel was the largest sales channel, suggesting that it could be a
profitable channel that could scale across the country.
In the spring of 2015, Lovepop enrolled in the 10-week Venture Incubation Program (VIP), which
helped Harvard students launch and scale companies through peer and expert mentoring, networking
opportunities, private workshops, and educational events. Through VIP, the founders received close
mentorship from Adrian Gill, an HBS graduate and the former vice president of Puma’s footwear
division, who provided particularly valuable advice as the team explored go-to-market strategies and
creative direction.
That spring, the founders were also selected to participate in HBS’s Rock Accelerator, which
awarded the Lovepop founders $5,500 toward their business expenses. The Rock Accelerator helped
firms prototype and iterate on their products, validate the go-to-market plan and build a business
model. The Rock website stated, “The chosen teams experience deep-dive coached sessions and checkins, pitch feedback and opportunities to pitch for seed funding. The goal is for teams to emerge from
the program with a strong foundation for building or expanding a market ready product.” 14 The team
spent the stipend on inventory.

Greeting Cards in 2015
In 2015, the greeting card publishing and related products market had estimated wholesale sales of
$4.8 billion, of which 55% was sales of single greeting cards and 12.4% was boxed greeting card sets. 15,e
Lovepop estimated that retail revenues for the entire industry were about $7 billion. Analysts
considered the industry to be declining at a rate of 5% per year, due in part to increased competition
from e-cards and the consolidation of downstream markets such as bookstores (see Exhibit 2 for
industry trends and information about major players). 16 In recent years, the industry had also
consolidated, resulting in a highly concentrated market dominated by two players. Hallmark Cards
Inc.—which sold its products at more than 30,000 stores in the U.S.—had 61.9% of the industry’s market
share. 17 The second-largest firm, American Greetings Corporation (AGC), which owned the high-end
Papyrus brand, accounted for 22.9%. 18 Analysts expected the industry to continue to decline at a rate
of nearly 5% between 2015 and 2020. 19 “Publishers of traditional print greeting cards are experiencing
intense competition from Internet companies that publish greeting cards online,” one industry report
noted. 20 “Related sources of competition include social media outlets such as Facebook and Instagram
that allow users to share free online greetings with friends and family. In addition, consumers are
increasingly using their own content, such as digital photos and videos, to create and send personalized
greeting cards. 21
Greeting card publishers sold through two main channels—wholesale and directly to consumers
via brick-and-mortar retail and e-commerce. Wholesale accounted for the vast majority of revenue.
Walmart alone accounted for 14% of the industry’s revenue in 2015, while Target accounted for 5%. 22
By contrast, direct-to-consumer sales accounted for just 11% of revenue. 23 (Remaining revenue was
driven by sales to stationery wholesalers, educational institutions, and other organizations. 24) The two
biggest industry players, Hallmark and AGC, sold most of their inventory in big-box, drug, and grocery

e The remaining product segments were consumer publishing including yearbooks, coloring books, postcards, and posters (24%),
business, trade, and professional publications (4%), and other services including selling advertising services (5%).

stores. Lovepop’s founders felt that this distribution strategy caused structural resistance to innovation
because the manufacturing gross margins were low (estimated at 25%) and the manufacturer carried
the risk of unsold inventory at their retail customers. The industry leaders also had sizeable retail
footprints: Hallmark sold inventory through more than 2,000 (mostly independently-operated)
Hallmark Crown Gold Stores, while AGC sold inventory to Schurman Fine Papers, which had acquired
AGC’s retail segment (including American Greetings, Carlton Cards, and Papyrus stores) in 2009. 25
Despite a decline in paper-based communication and the rise of e-cards, U.S. consumers purchased
6.5 billion cards in 2014. 26 However, consumer needs had shifted. “The biggest change we have seen
in the last three years is the consumers’ demand for a broader range of product,” said the president of
the U.S. Greeting Card Association. 27 “The consumer is not a monolithic character, they are a culturally
rich group—geographically segmented, age segmented and multi-culturally segmented.” 28 In 2012,
greeting cards retailed for an average of $2 to $4, but Papyrus cards and other high-end offerings could
cost as much as $10. 29 An estimated 80% of greeting card buyers were women. 30
Though not strictly considered greeting cards, wedding invitations represented another sizeable
stationery opportunity. E-cards were fairly popular in the wedding invitation space, with half of
wedding guests reporting that they received only digital invitations. 31 However, couples who opted
for paper invitations were often willing to pay a substantial sum; in 2014, the average wedding budget
allocated $439 for invitations, according to the Knot, a wedding website. 32 (The average guest list size
in 2015 was 136. 33) By 2015, many paper wedding invitations were purchased online.

Financing Lovepop
Lovepop’s first funding came from its founders, who each contributed $15,000 in savings
throughout the first year of the business to build the website, purchase inventory, and buy equipment.
As the company grew, the founders continued to invest money to ensure its survival. They also sought
external funding.
While modest, the initial funding Wise and Rose were able to raise kept the company above water.
In August 2014, Rose and Wise were awarded a $10,000 convertible grant in a Founder.org pitch
contest, which would automatically convert into equity if the company raised a financing round of at
least $500,000. In October 2014, Dorm Room Fund Boston, a venture fund that invested in full-time
students, said it would give the team a $20,000 convertible note. 34 Dorm Room’s Managing Partner
Bruno Faviero said, “It’s not very often that you see a product that makes you go, ‘Wow,’ but that’s
exactly what I heard all around the room when . . . Rose first brought a sample of LovePop’s cards to
the Dorm Room Fund team.” 35 In addition, Rough Draft Ventures, the student-led division of General
Catalyst, invested $12,500.
They also received assistance from a friend, Josh Rothman, who loaned the company $30,000. In
addition, the Rock Accelerator awarded them a $5,500 grant in the early spring of 2015, which they
spent on inventory. But by April of 2015, Lovepop was running out of money again. With help from
HBS classmate Sean Salas, who at the time was working on his own startup, Camino Financial, the
team was able to secure a loan in late April from small business lender OnDeck Capital for $40,000 at
28% annual interest. By the end of April 2015, Lovepop had achieved cumulative sales of $209,000. “In
hindsight, there wasn’t really a good reason for them to have given us this loan, or for us to have taken
it, but we needed the money,” Rose said. According to the founders’ estimates, the loan would last the
company through graduation from HBS but not much further. The founders knew they would need
additional capital to keep the company running. Lovepop’s monthly operating expenses in April were
$64,000, and the team expected costs to rise as they expanded their staff. Furthermore, they would need

to hire additional employees and cover start-up costs for the kiosks (estimated at $20,000 per kiosk), as
well as operational costs. The current plan was to open kiosks in two outlet malls near Las Vegas,
Nevada, as well three in California. They also signed a lease for May 1 for a kiosk in Washington, D.C.’s
Union Station train terminal. (See Exhibit 3 for 2014-2015 financials.)
During their final semester at HBS, Julia Austin, a local technology entrepreneur and HBS visiting
professor, gave a guest presentation in Rose’s Product Management 101 elective course. After class,
Rose introduced himself to Austin, showing her a sample Lovepop card, and describing his aspirations
for the company. Impressed, Austin offered to introduce the team to Ty Danco, managing director of
the Boston branch of the Techstars start-up accelerator. One company had dropped out of Techstars’
2015 summer cohort, and Danco encouraged Lovepop to apply to fill the opening. After an initial call
with Danco on April 17, the founders were invited to the Techstars office for an interview. Unlike the
other companies in the cohort, Lovepop was not a traditional technology company. “Initially, there
was debate inside as to whether they would be a good fit for Techstars, since the mission is to help
entrepreneurs bring new technologies to the market and their product was so different from anything
else we’ve done,” recalled Eveline Buchatskiy, a Techstars managing director. “But when we met the
team, we just immediately fell in love.” In particular, Techstars admired the team’s response to the
application question, “What’s your biggest accomplishment?” Instead of answering the question in
prose, the team forwarded a link to a short video that described a project they had undertaken with
friends to build a small steamboat-style raft for viewing the July 4 fireworks on Boston’s Charles River.
Danco reflected:
As soon as I saw their video about building the pirate “Miss USA” float, I knew we
had to have them. They showed technical skill, imagination, daring, efficiency all in one
short video, and the story behind that—breaking all the rules but then “pleading the
fourth”—proved to me that they had the right mentality for entrepreneurship. Then when
I saw that they were making real sales and proving demand while still students, it was an
easy decision to take them.
Soon after the team’s interview, on April 28, Techstars offered Lovepop a spot in their 2015 summer
cohort. The terms were identical to those presented to the other 11 participating companies: $18,000 in
cash in exchange for 6% equity, with an optional additional $100,000 convertible note.

Incubators and Accelerators
Start-up incubators emerged in the U.S. in the late 1950s, but earned particular fame during the
technology boom of the 1990s. In general, these organizations offered office space and administrative
support to new ventures for a low fee; in some cases, they also provided introductions to investors. 36
An estimated 93% were not-for-profit organizations and 33% had ties to higher education institutions. 37
Incubators supported entrepreneurs for up to several years. However, after the dot-com bubble burst
in 2001, many incubators shut down their operations. “Technology incubators, which invest in and
nurture new tech businesses . . . got a bad reputation in the bust, when firms like CMGI and
eCompanies lost billions of dollars on countless start-up failures whose names have long been
forgotten,” wrote Time magazine. 38 In the mid-2000s, a new type of start-up support organization
emerged: the seed accelerator.
The first accelerator, Y-Combinator (YC), was established in 2005 in California’s Silicon Valley as a
sort of boot camp that provided young technology businesses with training and support in exchange
for a small portion of equity. 39 Soon after, other accelerators emerged, adopting models that were the
same as or similar to YC’s. In contrast to incubators, accelerators were “fixed-term, cohort-based, ‘boot

camps’ for startups [that] offer[ed] educational and mentorship programs for startup founders,
exposing them to wide variety of mentors, including former entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, angel
investors, and corporate executives; and culminate in a public pitch event, or ‘demo day,’ during which
the graduating cohort of startup companies pitch their businesses to a large group of potential
investors.” 40 These programs, which were generally for-profit ventures, typically enrolled
entrepreneurs for 10-12 weeks, providing office space and a small amount of seed funding. Operating
under the theory that competition with the other cohort companies would drive performance,
accelerators helped firms “do in four months what it would take you 12 months to do on your own,”
said one observer. 41 In 2014, there were an estimated 215 accelerators in the U.S., up from 28 in 2009. 42
As researchers noted:
New programs appear nearly every month, and in many ways, accelerator
participation has become a rite of passage for budding entrepreneurs. Yet, with the
proliferation of programs, the newness of the phenomena, and little to no publicly
available data on outcomes for the programs and affiliated start-ups, it is hard for
entrepreneurs to determine which programs are most effective and, more importantly,
which specific program would be the best fit for their particular start-up’s goals. 43
The top selling point was exposure to investors. “Winning a place at one of New York City’s elite
startup accelerators is like getting accepted to Harvard or Yale—and many entrepreneurs go all-out to
secure what can be a powerful calling card,” wrote one observer. 44 This arrangement helped investors
vet new ventures: “If a company has the TechStars or Y-Combinator stamp of approval, it is probably
less risky than, say, a random person who emailed you with an idea,” wrote one writer. 45 Some saw
this as a shortcut for investors: “Cynics say that mentoring is just a form of due diligence and a way of
creating a ‘proprietary deal flow’—meaning privileged access to good deals,” an observer noted. 46
Shortly after YC’s emergence, Techstars was founded in 2006 in Boulder, Colorado and by 2007 had
expanded to Boston. By 2014, it had 14 active programs in various cities around the world, each of
which provided office space, seed funding ($18,000 in cash in exchange for 6% equity), and mentorship
to a cohort of new technology ventures. Of the 483 companies that were Techstars graduates in 2014,
77% were still operational and 11% had been acquired. 47 In 2015 rankings of U.S. accelerators, which
evaluated programs based on the average valuation of participating companies, the ability of those
companies to raise money, the “exit” rate of those firms, and the survival rate, Techstars placed among
the top programs. 48

Comparing the Offers
As their graduation from HBS approached, the two founders felt the stakes were rising for their
fledgling company. Despite all they had accomplished, they were running out of cash (see Exhibit 4
for a timeline of company milestones and Exhibit 5 for financing). In April 2015, Techstars Boston was
finalizing its cohort for the summer season, and they courted Lovepop aggressively. On April 25, the
founders received a video call from the Techstars team while out for dinner. The Techstars team
promised to help Lovepop close a seed round of $300,000 before the accelerator program even started.
Meanwhile, the founders were wrapping up their year-long remote mentorship program with
Founder.org, which had also offered the team seed funding to help scale the business. That offer
consisted of a $300,000 convertible note at a $3 million valuation cap (see Exhibit 6 for a summary of
the two offers). Founder.org had indicated that they would want this to be an exclusive seed round of
financing. This effectively meant that the team would need to choose between the two offers.

Without a clear sense of which option they should settle on, the founders sought input from close
friends. Wise’s girlfriend, Shan, encouraged them to join Techstars. “When she found out we were
debating not going to Techstars, she was incredulous,” Wise recalled. “She was like, you’re just the
most stubborn, pretentious people to think you’re going to turn down Techstars. What are you
thinking?” At the same time, a trusted classmate and experienced investor, Niko Hrdy, felt the terms
of the Founder.org note were favorable and encouraged them to take it. “He said the note was founderfriendly and reasonable,” Rose recalled. “He said if it was his company, he would take the money
instead of going to Techstars.”
Rose felt inclined to accept the Founder.org proposal, after judging it significantly less dilutive than
the Techstars offer. To date, the founders had not given up any equity, and Rose felt they should
continue to operate that way, especially now that they had the time to focus on scaling the retail kiosk
operation. Wise was leaning towards Techstars based on the name recognition within the investor
community and their offer to help raise additional funds.
There was also a remote possibility that Lovepop might someday appear on ABC’s Shark Tank, an
often transformative experience for early-stage ventures. In late April, Rose had received an email from
a Shark Tank executive requesting Lovepop’s updated sales figures. The odds of admission to Shark
Tank were low. In 2014, less than 1% of the 45,000 applicants were granted a taped meeting with the
“sharks,” and even fewer were broadcast on the show. 49 However, for the lucky firms that were
granted airtime, the returns were substantial. Some entrepreneurs received life-changing investments,
and even when rejected, most saw large boosts in sales. 50 One contestant, ScreenMend, saw its sales
jump from $4,000 to $1 million after its episode aired. 51
During the first week of May, the founders had performed many calculations to compare the
financial terms of the two offers. Which financing approach was appropriate for Lovepop at this stage?
Was it worth giving 6% of their company away so early?
Sitting in Wise’s pickup truck, they reviewed their calculations and discussed the broader strategic
implications of the choices. They compared the size, strength, and locations of the Techstars and
Founder.org networks. Techstars had a stronger brand name, and a larger alumni base. But as
graduates of HBS, Founder.org, the i-lab, and the Rock Accelerator, did they really need Techstars’
help? Did it make more sense to take Founder.org’s money and put fundraising questions on hold?
Which deal offered the team the best value? Techstars had assured them, “We’ll easily help you raise
$300,000, no problem,” Rose said. But he and Wise were skeptical. “We thought, ‘Who else is going to
give us $300,000 to sell paper cards? We have $300,000 right here from Founder.org. You can’t possibly
promise us you’re going to find $300,000 somewhere else.”
With no clear decision emerging, Wise and Rose decided to take a break and resume their
deliberation over a beer. They climbed out of the pickup and headed across the Fort Point Channel to
Boston’s Seaport District.
