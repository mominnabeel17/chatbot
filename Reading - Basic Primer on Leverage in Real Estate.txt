A Basic Primer on Leverage in Real Estate
Jahan Moslehi, GSB ‘10
Important Underwriting Ratios
Debt Coverage (DCR)
The debt coverage ratio is the ratio of NOI to financing payments
DCR = NOI/Mortgage Payments
This is the measure of the cushion that property cash flows have before falling below required debt
payments. Lenders generally want this to be greater than 1.20 for secured first mortgages.
Loan to Value (LTV)
This equals the principal amount of the loan divided by the estimated market value of the property:
LTV = Loan Amount/Property Value
This is a measure of the equity cushion the lender believes they have before value has fallen to the
point that the property’s value is less than the loan. For commercial real estate, the LTV for secured
first mortgages ranges from 50-70%.
“Sizing” the Loan
A lender will generally “size’ the loan at the lower of its required DCR and maximum LTV ratio.
Leverage
There are 4 primary reasons to take on leverage:
1. You do not have enough cash to buy or develop the property outright
2. Even if you have the cash, you want to diversify your investments
3. Interest provides a tax shield
4. You can “juice” your returns
Total returns from the investment can be broken down into 2 components:
• Capital Appreciation: derived from the building appreciating in value
• Cash Flow Return: derived from the cash flows generated by the property
To illustrate the effects of leverage on capital appreciation, assume that you purchase a building
for $100 million and it appreciates 20% in 3 years. Consider three different capital structures: A (0%
debt), B (50% debt), and C (80% debt). Your three-year equity return for each scenario is outlined
in this table:

Original Debt
Original Equity
Debt Repayment (in year 3)
New Equity Value
Equity Return

0% Debt
$0MM
$100MM
$0MM
$120MM
20%

87

50% Debt
$50MM
$50MM
$50MM
$70MM
40%

80% Debt
$80MM
$20MM
$80MM
$40MM
100%

Make sure you understand how these equity returns are calculated.
Now suppose the building depreciates by 20% in 3 years. This is what happens to your returns:

Original Debt
Original Equity
Debt Repayment (in year 3)
New Equity Value
Equity Return

0% Debt
$0MM
$100MM
$0MM
$80MM
-20%

50% Debt
$50MM
$50MM
$50MM
$30MM
-40%

80% Debt
$80MM
$20MM
$80MM
$0MM
-100%

As this example illustrates, leverage increases the risk of equity since debt holders get paid before
equity holders. In good times, equity returns are juiced and in bad times losses are magnified. This
is how leverage affects capital appreciation. Remember that in the above examples, the equity
returns shown are three-year returns. To get annual returns use the following formula: (1 + 3yr
Return)^(1/3) – 1. So if you use 50% debt and the property appreciates 20% in three years, your
annualized return from capital appreciation is 11.9%.
Now consider the effect of leverage on cash flow return. Consider the property above. Suppose
you get a 50% loan at a 5% interest rate and so you pay $2.5MM in interest per year ($50MM x 5%).
If you bought the property at an 8% cap rate (after reserves), it generates $8MM in NOI per year.
The property cash flows are greater than the interest paid to the lender, so you have positive
leverage. With positive leverage, your pre-tax return on equity, also referred to as your cash-oncash yield, is higher (11%) than it would be without leverage (8%):
NOI
Interest
Cash flow before Tax
Equity Investment
Pre-Tax Equity Return

$8.0MM
$2.5MM
$5.5MM
$50MM
11%

So in the above example, you have an annual cash flow return of 11% and an annual capital
appreciation return of 11.9%. If all of your assumptions are true, you have a total IRR of 22.9%.
Now suppose that two of the three major tenants vacate and your NOI is reduced to $2MM. Now
your cash flow is -$0.5MM. Your cash-on-cash yield is -1% ($-0.5MM/$50MM). If you did not
have leverage, your cash-on-cash yield would be 2% ($2MM/$100MM). The negative leverage
forces you to come out of pocket to cover the shortfall from NOI in order to pay your debt service.
Although in the short term, you may have negative leverage, in the long term (due to capital
appreciation or growth in NOI) you may still have positive leverage from a total return perspective.
Other Effects of Leverage
Remember from our discussion of the Perfect Property that the value of a property is determined by
the present value of the future cash flows discounted by an appropriate discount rate (r). Without
leverage and assuming an NPV of zero, that appropriate discount rate becomes the unleveraged
IRR of the property, also called the return on assets. Also, remember that under Perfect Property
assumptions the IRR is equal to the cap rate plus the growth rate.

Although leverage does not increase the risk of your assets, it increases the risk of your equity. A
simple way of expressing this extra financial risk from leverage is through the weighted average
cost of capital formula:
Return on Assets =
(Debt/Assets) * (Return on Debt) + (Equity/Assets) * (Return on Equity)
This equation can also be stated as:
Return on Equity =
(1+ Debt/Equity) * (Return on Assets) - (Debt/Equity) * (Return on Debt)
So assume you have a property with a 7% cap rate and 3% growth rate. If you assume perfect
property, this gives you a return on assets of 10%. If you put on 50% leverage and borrow at an 8%
interest rate, your return on equity is:
((1+1) * 10%) – (1*8%)) = 20% - 8% = 12%
Because your cost of debt is below your total return on assets, leverage increases your return on
equity and thus you have you overall positive leverage. If your interest rate was 12%, your return
on equity would be 8%, which is less than your unlevered return on assets of 10%. In this case, you
have negative leverage.
So how should we think about the fact that the cap rate of 7% is below your interest rate of 8%?
You can think of the cap rate in a perfect property as your unlevered cash-on-cash yield. So in your
first year, you experience negative leverage on the cash flow return component of your return.
However, due to the growth rate of 3%, at some point in the future, you start experiencing positive
leverage as your NOI increases. Therefore, if you think the g is going to be large enough, or the
capital appreciation is going to be large enough, it may make sense to start with negative leverage on
your cash flow return because the effect of leverage on your total return may still be positive. This
is what Tishman and Blackrock thought for Stuy Town but of course that did not happen.

Construction loans are used to develop property. The developer prepares a budget and obtains a
loan to take the property to the point of stabilization at which point the loan will need to be paid off
by the sale of the property (merchant builder) or refinanced with a permanent mortgage (portfolio
builder). Construction loans are typically short term and recourse. The borrower signs on the
loan personally guaranteeing lien free completion and repayment in full. If there are insufficient net
89

proceeds from sale or refinancing to pay off the construction loan, the lender has recourse to the
borrower’s other assets. Construction loans are typically a percentage of total development cost
(though the lender is highly focused on value as we note in Morgan Hill). The loan to cost can be
higher than for a permanent loan because of the recourse provisions. The lender will want to see
the borrower’s equity invested first. There will be a line item in the budget for interest during
construction and during the lease up period to carry the property until say 95% occupancy is
achieved. The cost of capital is a cost just as is concrete and labor. In effect, the lenders lend the
borrower money to pay themselves interest. Draws on the loan are monthly based upon
inspections to verify progress. Loans are typically floating. Commercial banks are the dominant
lenders.
Permanent loans are sized based upon income achieved and on loan to value test. Typical loan to
value for commercial property is 50-70% though leverage can be higher for apartments through the
Government Sponsored Entities (Fannie and Freddie) who can lend up to 80%. The second test is
debt service coverage. The NOI of the property should be a minimum of 1.2 X the debt service
which includes interest and principal. Loans are generally amortized over a 30-year period with
constant monthly payments. The loan will typically have a term of 5-10 years. The amortization of
principal over that period is intended to increase the lender’s security. Permanent loans are nonrecourse. The lender only has access to the property as collateral and if things do not go well, the
borrower can “give back the keys.” The borrower will only lose his or her equity (and perhaps his
or her reputation). Loans may be securitized and sold into the capital markets. Other lenders are
pension funds and insurance companies. Because most permanent lenders match their sources of
financing there are typically prepayment penalties. If the borrower prepays the loan, they may be
required to cover the difference between the contractual rate and short term rates for the remaining
terms of the loan. This is called yield maintenance and can be very expensive!
Amortization Explained
On Canvas is an example of a 30-year fully amortizing loan. As you can see the simple math works
out that the initial payments are almost all interest so that the amortization over the first 10 years is
modest. The final payments at the end of the 30 years are virtually all principal with very little
interest. You should review the model and be comfortable with how the amortization schedule
works.

Notes on Mortgages and Real Estate Finance
Professors Steve Grenadier & Doug Abbey
II. Mortgage Calculations
A. Fully Amortizing Mortgages
 A very common type of loan.


Equal payments at fixed intervals (typically monthly).



The lender gives you the loan amount. In return, you promise equal payments over the
life of the loan. The payment level must be set such that the lender receives the IRR
equal to the interest rate on the loan.

Loan Amount =

Payment
(1+r)1

+

Payment
(1+r)2

+

Payment
(1+r)n

Where r is the per-period interest rate and there are n equal payments on the loan.
Example: A 30-year loan, payable monthly at 12% interest per year for $100,000.
n = 30 x 12 = 360
r = 0.12/12 = 0.01
Loan Amount = $100,00


This is an equation with one unknown. You can solve it using Solver, the Excel function
PMT (.01,360,100000), on your calculator. Or using the mathematical solution:
r x Loan Amount
PMT =
1
1–
(1+r)n



The solution is $1,028.61 per month or $12,343.35 per year



This works out to a mortgage constant of
12,343.35/100,000=12.34%



Note that it is by convention that we use a monthly IRR of the annual interest rate divided
by 12. In the example, the true IRR of the loan is 1% per month or 12.68% annually. This
is greater than the stated rate of 12% due to monthly compounding.

91



Consider how each mortgage payment is divided up into interest and principal:
Month

Beginning
Balance

100,000

99,972

99,943

999.43

Principal

28.3

28.57

99.972

99,943

99,914

Ending Balance


At the end of month 360, the ending balance is exactly zero.



Over much of the early life of the loan almost all of the payments go to interest. Towards
the end of the loan the payments become mostly principal.



If you pay off the load at the end of month 3 (and if there is no prepayment penalty) then
you owe $99,914.

What is the remaining balance on the loan if you pay off the loan at the end of 10 years?


One way is to use Excel to continue the table we did above.



Another way is to calculate the present value of the remaining promised mortgage payments.
After 10-years you still owe 20 x 12 = 240 monthly payments of $1,028.61. Discounting this
at the monthly mortgage rate of 1% gives a present value of $93,418.



Thus, after making 120 mortgage payments you would still owe over 93% of the mortgage
balance.

Mortgage “Points”
 A mortgage point is an initial financing charge.


One point equals one percent of the loan amount and is paid upfront.



For a $100,000 loan a two-point fee means the borrower must pay $2,000 in an upfront fee.



The mortgage payments are not affected by this; they are still $1,028.61 per month.



Thus, the IRR to the lender is higher than the mortgage rate.



Generally, you can deduct points on a loan to purchase a property, but you must amortize
them on a refinance loan.
92

The Choice Between Points and Interest Rates
 In the mortgage market the borrower may typically choose between various combination
of points and interest rates.


Loans with higher points will have lower interest rates.

How should you choose?
 In general, if you plan on holding the mortgage for a long time (not move nor refinance)
then having a lower interest rate is preferable (i.e., the initial points are amortized over a
long life). Conversely, if you plan on paying off the mortgage early, you are better off
with less points and a higher interest rate.


What makes this analysis complicated is that the lender “knows this” and assumes that
people who choose higher points will hold the loan longer. This is an adverse selection
problem (asymmetric information).

B. Interest Only Mortgages
 Mortgage payments include only interest.


All principal (the total loan amount) is repaid at the end.



This is similar to a standard bond contract.



Going back to our example, with an interest only loan, the monthly payments will be
only $1,000 and the principal to be repaid at the end of 30 years will be $100,000.



Typically you would need to either sell the property or take out a new loan to pay off the
mortgage.



Provides somewhat less security to the lender since there is no gradual paying down of
the mortgage.

C. Balloon Mortgages
 Falls in between fully amortizing and interest only mortgages.


Consider the following example:

Example: A 10-year loan, payable monthly, 12% interest per year, for $100,000, amortized over 30
years
 Since this is amortized over 30 years the payment is just as in the first example, $1,028.61.


However, the loan is due at the end of 10 years. Thus, there is a balloon payment. The
amount owed is the remaining balance of the loan, previously calculated at $93,418.

93

II. Contracts and Real Estate Loans
 Real estate contracts must be in writing. This is due to the “Statute of Frauds”.


Thus, real estate loans, purchase and sale contracts, long-term leases and brokerage
listing contracts must be in writing to be enforceable in court. Oral contracts are not
enforceable with real estate contracts.



There are 2 contracts underlying a real estate loan.

A. Promissory Note (the “Note”)
 This outlines the terms of the loan.


The amount loaned, interest and principal payments, term, etc.

B. Deed of Trust (or Mortgage)
 This is the security/collateral agreement


In some states (like California) it is called a Deed of Trust. In others it is called a
mortgage.



This makes the property collateral for the loan



“Hypothecation” means giving something as security for a loan, but without giving up
possession.



Thus a “lien” is placed against the property.



The lien must be recorded (filed as a public record) in order to be valid.

Deed of Trust – a three party instrument


Trustor (borrower)



Beneficiary (lender)



Trustee (third party, like a title company)

Mortgage – a two party instrument


Mortgagor (borrower)



Mortgagee (lender)

How it works under a Deed of Trust
Trustor deeds legal title for security

If debt is fully repaid
Trustee reconveys title back to Trustor (Deed of Reconveyance)

Trustor

Trustee

If borrower defaults on loan, the beneficiary can order the trustee to hold a trustee’s sale to sell the
property. (Foreclosure).


Foreclosure under a deed of trust is rather simple and quick since it avoids the court
system.



It might take, on average, 4 months for the process to complete (only 3 weeks in Texas).



After sale, the borrower loses all rights in the property.



Foreclosure under a mortgage requires the court system



It can take one year or more



Often even after foreclosure the borrower has a one year right of redemption to buy back
the property.



Thus, the deed of trust system is a much more efficient means of transferring title.

NOTE: California has what are known as “anti-deficiency” laws. Thus, when you borrow money
to purchase real estate, and use a deed of trust, then the lender has access only to the property in the
event of foreclosure. Even if the property is worth less than the amount owed (typical) they cannot
sue you for the deficiency.
III. Some Important Loan Clauses
A. Due on Sale Clause
 Upon sale of the property the loan is due and payable.
B. Prepayment Penalty
 If a loan is paid-off early there may be a penalty attached.


Generally, for residential loans such penalties are restricted.
95



For commercial real estate they are quite common and may require the borrower to
maintain the lender’s yield.

C. Junior Mortgages
 An owner may choose to take out more than one loan on a property.


The highest priority loan (generally the first one recorded) is the first loan. Afterwards
there can be a second loan, a third loan, etc.



In the event of a foreclosure the proceeds go first to the first loan, then the second loan,
etc. If anything is left over (doubtful) it goes to the owner.
