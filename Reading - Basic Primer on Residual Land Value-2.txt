A Basic Primer on Residual Land Value
Doug Abbey and Chris Mahowald, GSB ‘89
Development begins with the purchase of a vacant piece of land. How much is the land worth? A
quick method is to evaluate comparable parcels of land nearby. Are they truly comparable? And
where do the “comps” get their value from?
The correct technique is to calculate residual land value analysis. Developers back into the
maximum price to pay for the parcel. To determine land value, developers project the value of the
completed development, and then subtract all the costs of development (including projected profit
margin or mark-up).
To calculate residual land value the following inputs are required:
• NOI
• Cap Rate
• Hard Costs (construction)
• Soft Costs (interest, legal, financing, due diligence, etc.)
• Required Profit Margin to undertake the risks of development
A Residual Land Value Example
The projected NOI of an office building is $100, and the cap rate is 5%.
Projected Value then equals $2,000 ($100/5%).
Total construction cost is $1,000 and soft costs are $300
Required profit markup is 20%.
We back into the required profit by division:
•
•

$2,000/1.2 = $1,667
The total development cost (including land) that the project
could support to allow for a 20% profit mark-up
$2,000-$1,667 = $333
The required profit – hence a “factor of production” or
“cost”

Calculation of Residual Land Value
Projected Building Value
Less Construction
Less Soft Costs
Less Required Profit

$2,000
($1,000)
($300)
($333)

Equals Residual Land Value $367

The maximum amount the developer can pay for the land and retain the minimum 20% profit
margin. If the land can be bought at a lower price, the developer’s projected profit would be in
excess of the 20% hurdle.
Now let’s reverse the math. If the developer buys the land for $367, here is the pro forma:
Construction
Plus Soft Cost
Plus Land
Total Development Costs including Land but excluding profit
Let’s see what the margin is.
Projected Value
Less Total Development Cost (Excluding Profit)
Projected Profit
Projected Profit Markup (333/1,667)

$2,000
($1,667)
$333
20%

$1,000
$300
$367
