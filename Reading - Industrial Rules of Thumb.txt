Industrial Rules of Thumb
▪

Typical land coverage is 45 - 50%.

▪

Parking ratio of one per thousand square feet is sufficient.

▪

28 clear height permits racking 6 pallets high (a pallet is 4x4x4). Truck carries two pallets
high.

▪

Clear height below 20 feet can be problematic.

▪

Many newer buildings have clear height up to 36 feet with sophisticated picking systems
but these are quite specialized facilities. Forklifts don’t work that high!

▪

Industrial space is a commodity. It’s just a box. Tenants will move across the street for
a penny in rent. They can pick up in the middle of the night and move. Therefore
location and submarket are critical.

▪

Truck Court should be over 110 feet (130 is desirable). Trucks are getting longer and now
are up to 59 feet. Shorter truck court will not accommodate today’s trucks. Also
assess truck maneuverability.

▪

Best building shape is a rectangle.

▪

Flexibility to accommodate varying tenant sizes is important in retaining building value. A
warehouse 200 feet deep and 400 - 600 feet long is better than a square. It permits space to be
subdivided “salami” style down to 12,000 sf (60 x 200). Typical tenant “pyramid” has a number
of smaller tenants and few larger ones.

▪

Truck doors are important—one per10,000 sf is good for large building tenant. “Salami”
building results in 3 dock doors and one at grade for a 12,000 sf space.

▪

Typical office space is 5-10%. If there is more office space, many tenants will require you t
to demolish excess. Don’t think amortized rent for higher office finish should be
capped!

▪

Industrial is lowest land use in the commercial property food chain. It has lowest intensity
of ground coverage. Opportunities for conversion to a higher use (for example
warehouses in Silicon Valley are being torn down for residential use).
